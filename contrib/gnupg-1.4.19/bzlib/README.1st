This is a stripped down version of bzip2 - version 1.0.6.

It does not include any drivers but merely builds the libbz2.a
library.  The source has been taken from www.bzip.org on 2010-09-23
and stripped down by g10 Code GmbH for use with Gpg4win and to be
included into the GnupG 1.4.12 source.

The only changed files are Makefile and bzlib.h (disabled Windows
specific code).
