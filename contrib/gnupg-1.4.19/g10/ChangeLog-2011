	NB: ChangeLog files are no longer manually maintained.  Starting
	on December 1st, 2011 we put change information only in the GIT
	commit log, and generate a top-level ChangeLog file from logs at
	"make dist".  See doc/HACKING for details.

2011-09-12  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* gpg.c [__VMS]: Include vms.h.
	(main) [__VMS]: Init batch mode according to actual process mode.
	Suggested by Steven M. Schweda.

2011-08-09  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	overflow when picking an algorithm (not a security issue since we
	can't pick something not present in all preference lists, but we
	might pick something that isn't scored first choice).

	handling of MD5 in preference lists.  Instead of replacing MD5
	with SHA-1, just remove MD5 from the list altogether, and let the

2010-09-28  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.skel: Make the example for force-v3-sigs match
	reality (it has defaulted to off since 2007-10-22).

2007-10-23  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	Switched entire package to GPLv3+.

2007-10-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpg.c (main): Add --require-cross-certification to
	--openpgp/--rfc4880 mode.

	* gpg.c (main): Disable --rfc2440-text and --force-v3-sigs by
	default.  Enable --require-cross-certification by default.
	--openpgp (--rfc4880) is the same as --rfc2440 except with
	"--enable-dsa2 --no-rfc2440-text --escape-from-lines".

2007-10-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* misc.c (compliance_option_string, compliance_failure): Minor
	cleanup.

	* armor.c (is_armor_header): Comment about 4880.

2007-10-17  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, gpg.c (main), misc.c (compliance_option_string): Add
	--rfc4880, and make --openpgp an alias to it.  --rfc2440 now
	stands alone.  For now, use the old 2440 defaults for 4880.

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu): Use compliance_option_string() instead
	of printing the compliance modes here.

2007-09-02  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* import.c (collapse_uids): Significant speedup for de-duping user
	IDs.

2007-08-24  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* keyring.c (keyring_register_filename): Use same_file_p.
	Suggested by Kurt Fitzner.

2007-07-19  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpg.c (main): Fix typo.  Noted by John Clizbe.

	* armor.c (parse_header_line): Improve test so that the header
	test only allows "Hash" in the signed data section.

2007-07-18  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* armor.c (is_armor_tag): New.  Detect if an armor header matches
	2440bis-21.
	(parse_header_line): Call it here, as bis-21 requires warning the
	user (but continuing to process the message) when seeing an
	unknown header.

2007-07-09  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* gpg.c: Better print an extra warning if Camellia has been
	configured.

2007-07-06  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* encode.c (encode_crypt): Missed one call to
	setup_plaintext_name().  This is bug#809.

2007-06-12  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* sign.c (mk_notation_policy_etc): expect all sigs that this is
	called for are >=v4.
	(write_signature_packets, make_keysig_packet): Only call it for
	>=v4 sigs.  This allows --force-v3-sigs and --force-v4-certs to
	enable or disable notations, policies, and keyserver URLs.  This
	is bug#800.

2007-05-09  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* openfile.c (overwrite_filep, open_outfile) [W32]: Need to use
	just "nul".  Though, I am pretty sure that some MSDOS versions
	grok the extra /dev/.

2007-05-07  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* openfile.c (open_outfile, overwrite_filep) [W32]: Use "/dev/nul".

2007-04-16  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* packet.h, mainproc.c (reset_literals_seen): New function to
	reset the literals count.

	* verify.c (verify_one_file), decrypt.c (decrypt_messages): Call
	it here so we allow multiple literals in --multifile mode (in
	different files - not concatenated together).

	* gpg.c, pkclist.c: #include <strings.h> for strcasecmp if it is
	present.  Note that autoconf protects us against a strings.h that
	cannot be used together with string.h.

2007-04-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* parse-packet.c (parse_marker): New.  Enforce that the marker
	contains 'P', 'G', 'P', and nothing but.
	(parse): Call it here.
	(skip_packet): No longer need to handle marker packets here.

2007-03-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c: Windows Vista doesn't grok X_OK and so fails
	access() tests.  Previous versions interpreted X_OK as F_OK
	anyway, so we'll just use F_OK directly.

2007-03-08  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* plaintext.c (handle_plaintext): Add two extra fflush for stdout.

2007-03-06  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu): If we modify the keyblock (via
	fix_keyblock() or collapse_uids()) make sure we reprocess the
	keyblock so the flags are correct.  Noted by Robin H. Johnson.

	* getkey.c (fixup_uidnode): Properly clear flags that don't apply
	to us (revoked, expired) so that we can reprocess a uid.

2007-03-01  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, gpg.c (main), mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print): Allow
	multiple sig verification again as this is protected via the
	multiple-messages code.

2007-02-26  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* gpg.c (main): Add verify option show-primary-uid-only.
	* options.h (VERIFY_SHOW_PRIMARY_UID_ONLY): New.
	* mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print): Implement it.

	* status.h (STATUS_ERROR): New status code.
	* status.c (get_status_string): Ditto.
	* mainproc.c (proc_plaintext): Emit it if multiple messages are
	detected.

2007-02-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* mainproc.c (literals_seen): New.
	(proc_plaintext): Error out if more than one plaintext packet is
	encountered

	* options.h, gpg.c: New option --allow-multiple-messages and --no
	variant.

2007-02-13  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* parse-packet.c (parse_signature): It's hex.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_subkey): Avoid listing the contents of
	a backsig when list mode is on.  Noted by Timo Schulz.

2007-02-04  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* parse-packet.c (parse_signature): Limit bytes read for an
	unknown alogorithm.  Fixes Debian bug#402592.

2007-02-01  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* main.h, keygen.c (ask_expire_interval, parse_expire_string):
	Pass in the time to use to calculate the expiration offset, rather
	than querying it internally.  Change all callers.

2007-01-31  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (do_generate_keypair, proc_parameter_file)
	(generate_keypair, generate_subkeypair): Pass a timestamp through
	to all the gen_xxx functions.

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids): Another multiple to single timestamp
	operation.

	* sign.c (write_plaintext_packet): Take timestamp from outside.
	Change all callers.
	(sign_file, clearsign_file, sign_symencrypt_file): Calculate one
	timestamp for the whole transaction.  Different timestamps for
	each step can leak performance information.

	* main.h, keygen.c (ask_expiredate), keyedit.c (menu_expire):
	Remove the need for ask_expiredate().

2007-01-30  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (make_backsig, write_direct_sig, write_selfsigs)
	(write_keybinding): Have the various selfsigs created during key
	generation use the timestamp of their parent key.  This helps
	avoid leaking information about the performance of the machine
	where the keys were generated.  Noted by Christian Danner.

2007-01-15  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* parse-packet.c (read_protected_v3_mpi): Make sure to stop
	reading even for corrupted packets.
	* keygen.c (generate_user_id): Need to allocate one byte more.
	Reported by Felix von Leitner.

2006-12-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.skel: Tweak some examples to match reality and update
	the RFC for CERT now that it is out of draft.

2006-12-13  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am: Install options.skel via dist_pkgdata_DATA so that
	"make uninstall" works properly.

2006-12-13  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* gpgv.c, gpg.c: Do not include the now removed g10defs.h file.

2006-12-11  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* seskey.c (encode_session_key, do_encode_md): Use new
	mpi_nlimb_hint_from_nbytes function.
	* sign.c (do_sign): Ditto.

	* Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS): Define GNUPG_LIBDIR.
	* gpgv.c (i18n_init): s/G10_LOCALEDIR/LOCALEDIR/.
	* gpg.c (i18n_init): Ditto.

2006-12-07  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS): Define GNUPG_DATADIR.
	* openfile.c (copy_options_file): Use log_info and not log_error
	to avoid error returns in case of a missing skeleton file.

2006-12-04  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* filter.h (armor_filter_context_t): New field REFCOUNT.
	* armor.c (new_armor_context, release_armor_context)
	(push_armor_filter): New.
	(armor_filter): Call releae_armor_context for IOBUFCTRL_FREE.
	* import.c (import): Use the new function here instead of the
	old hack using the iobuf_push_filter2.
	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Ditto.

2006-12-03  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* keyedit.c (menu_clean): Made strings translatable.

2006-12-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (menu_clean): Show "already minimized" rather than
	"already clean" when a minimized key is minimized again.  From
	Dirk Traulsen.

2006-12-02  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, gpg.c (main), passphrase.c (passphrase_to_dek): Add
	--passphrase-repeat option to control how many times gpg will
	re-prompt for a passphrase to ensure the user has typed it
	correctly.  Defaults to 1.

2006-12-02  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* encr-data.c: Allocate DFX context on the heap and not on the
	stack.  Changes at several places.  Fixes CVE-2006-6235.

2006-11-27  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* openfile.c (ask_outfile_name): Fixed buffer overflow occurring
	if make_printable_string returns a longer string.  Fixes bug 728.

2006-10-23  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* gpg.c (main): New command --gpgconf-list.

2006-10-12  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* parse-packet.c (parse_symkeyenc): Show the unpacked as well as
	the packed s2k iteration count.

	* main.h, options.h, gpg.c (encode_s2k_iterations, main),
	passphrase.c (hash_passphrase): Add --s2k-count option to specify
	the number of s2k hash iterations.

2006-10-06  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Write the 16-digit keyid rather
	than whatever key selector the user used on the command line.

2006-10-02  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* encr-data.c (decrypt_data, mdc_decode_filter): Check the MDC
	right here and don't let parse-packet handle the MDC.

2006-08-21  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* skclist.c (is_insecure): Also test for uppercase version of the
	insecure string.

2006-07-31  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* openfile.c (open_outfile) [USE_ONLY_8DOT3]: Search backwards for
	the dot.  Fixes bug 654.

	* passphrase.c (agent_open): Use log_info instead of log_error to
	allow a fallback without having gpg return an error code.  Fixes
	bug #655.

	* encode.c (encode_crypt_files): Invalidate the whole fd cache.
	This is a workaround for problems in iobuf's stupid fd cache.
	* decrypt.c (decrypt_messages): Ditto.
	* verify.c (verify_files): Ditto.

2006-07-26  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* keygen.c (gen_card_key_with_backup): Initialize sk_{un}protected.

	* import.c (import): Initialize KEYBLOCK.

	* pkclist.c (edit_ownertrust): Intialize trust to avoid gcc
	warning.

	* parse-packet.c (parse_comment): Cap comments at 65k.
	(parse_gpg_control): Skip too large control packets.

2006-06-28  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keydb.h, pkclist.c (select_algo_from_prefs, algo_available):
	Pass a union for preference hints rather than doing void * games.

	* sign.c (sign_file): Use it here.

	* sign.c (sign_file): When signing with multiple DSA keys, one
	being DSA1 and one being DSA2 and encrypting at the same time, if
	the recipient preferences give a hash that can work with the DSA2
	key, then allow the DSA1 key to be promoted rather than giving up
	and using hash_for().

	* pkclist.c (algo_available): Automatically enable DSA2 mode when
	handling a key that clearly isn't DSA1 (i.e. q!=160).

2006-06-28  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* import.c (check_prefs_warning): Fix change for better
	translatability.

	* app-openpgp.c (do_writekey): Fixed computation of memmove
	length.  This led to garbled keys if E was larger than one byte.
	Thanks to Achim Pietig for hinting at the garbled E.

2006-06-27  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* gpg.c (reopen_std) [HAVE_W32_SYSTEM]: Do not use it.

2006-06-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, gpg.c (main), keygen.c (keygen_upd_std_prefs,
	keygen_add_std_prefs, proc_parameter_file): Add
	--default-keyserver-url to specify a keyserver URL at key
	generation time, and "Keyserver:" keyword for doing the same
	through a batch file.

	* sign.c (do_sign): Accept a truncated hash even for DSA1 keys (be
	liberal in what you accept, etc).

2006-06-12  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* import.c (import_one): Add a flag (from_sk) so we don't check
	prefs on an autoconverted public key.  The check should only
	happen on the sk side.  Noted by Dirk Traulsen.

2006-06-09  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (gen_card_key): Add optional argument to return a
	pointer (not a copy) of the stub secret key for the secret key we
	just generated on the card.
	(generate_card_subkeypair): Use it here so that the signing key on
	the card can use the card to generate the 0x19 backsig on the
	primary key.  Noted by Janko Heilgeist and Jonas Oberg.

	* parse-packet.c (parse_user_id): Cap the user ID size at 2048
	bytes.  This prevents a memory allocation attack with a very large
	user ID.  A very large packet length could even cause the
	allocation (a u32) to wrap around to a small number.  Noted by
	Evgeny Legerov on full-disclosure.

2006-05-25  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (gen_dsa): Allow generating DSA2 keys
	(allow specifying sizes > 1024 when --enable-dsa2 is set).  The
	size of q is set automatically based on the key size.
	(ask_keysize, generate_keypair): Ask for DSA size when
	--enable-dsa2 is set.

2006-05-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* exec.c (make_tempdir): Fix bug with a temporary directory on
	Win32 that is over 256 bytes long.  Noted by Israel G. Lugo.

2006-05-23  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpg.c (reopen_std): New function to reopen fd 0, 1, or 2 if we
	are called with them closed.  This is to protect our
	keyring/trustdb files from corruption if they get attached to one
	of the standard fds.  Print a warning if possible that this has
	happened, and fail completely if we cannot reopen (should never
	happen).
	(main): Call it here.

2006-05-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* parse-packet.c (dump_sig_subpkt, parse_signature),
	build-packet.c (build_sig_subpkt_from_sig), getkey.c
	(fixup_uidnode, merge_selfsigs_main, merge_selfsigs_subkey),
	keygen.c (keygen_add_key_expire): Fix meaning of key expiration
	and sig expiration subpackets - zero means "never expire"
	according to 2440, not "expire instantly".

	* getkey.c (get_pubkey_byname), import.c (import_one): Fix key
	selection problem when auto-key-locate returns a list of keys, not
	all of which are usable (revoked, expired, etc).  Noted by Simon
	Josefsson.

2006-04-26  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (direct_uri_map): New.
	(keyserver_spawn): Used here to add "_uri" to certain gpgkeys_xxx
	helpers when the meaning is different if a path is provided
	(i.e. ldap).
	(keyserver_import_cert): Show warning if there is a CERT
	fingerprint, but no --keyserver set.

2006-04-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c: Fix build problem with platforms that stick libcurl
	in a place not in the regular include search path.

2006-04-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, gpg.c (main): Add --enable-dsa2 and --disable-dsa2.
	Defaults to disable.

	* pkclist.c (algo_available): If --enable-dsa2 is set, we're
	allowed to truncate hashes to fit DSA keys.

	* sign.c (match_dsa_hash): New.  Return the best match hash for a
	given q size.
	(do_sign, hash_for, sign_file): When signing with a DSA key, if it
	has q==160, assume it is an old DSA key and don't allow truncation
	unless --enable-dsa2 is also set.  q!=160 always allows truncation
	since they must be DSA2 keys.
	(make_keysig_packet): If the user doesn't specify a
	--cert-digest-algo, use match_dsa_hash to pick the best hash for
	key signatures.

2006-04-19  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpg.c (print_mds), armor.c (armor_filter, parse_hash_header):
	Add SHA-224.

	* sign.c (write_plaintext_packet), encode.c (encode_simple):
	Factor common literal packet setup code from here, to...

	* main.h, plaintext.c (setup_plaintext_name): Here. New. Make sure
	the literal packet filename field is UTF-8 encoded.

	* options.h, gpg.c (main): Make sure --set-filename is UTF-8
	encoded and note when filenames are already UTF-8.

2006-04-18  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (menu_backsign): Give some more verbose errors when we
	have no need to backsign.

2006-04-11  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.skel, photoid.c (get_default_photo_command): Find an
	image viewer at runtime.  Seems FC5 doesn't have xloadimage.

2006-04-08  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* getkey.c (parse_auto_key_locate): Fix dupe-removal code.

	* keyedit.c (menu_backsign): Allow backsigning even if the secret
	subkey doesn't have a binding signature.

	* armor.c (radix64_read): Don't report EOF when reading only a pad
	(=) character.  The EOF actually starts after the pad.

	* gpg.c (main): Make --export, --send-keys, --recv-keys,
	--refresh-keys, and --fetch-keys follow their arguments from left
	to right.  Suggested by Peter Palfrader.

2006-04-08  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* mainproc.c (list_node): Print ring trust value only if not empty
	and --with-colons has been given.

2006-04-05  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* getkey.c (user_id_not_found_utf8): New.
	(get_primary_uid, get_user_id): Use it.  Fixes Debian bug #205028
	in the right way.

2006-04-03  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* import.c (check_prefs_warning): Merged strings for better
	translation.

	* gpg.c (main) [__GLIBC__]: Default to libpcsclite.so.1.

	* status.h, status.c (STATUS_BEGIN_SIGNING): New.  Suggested by
	Daiki Ueno.
	* textfilter.c (copy_clearsig_text): Issue new status code.
	* sign.c (sign_file, sign_symencrypt_file): Ditto.

2006-03-31  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* getkey.c (get_pubkey_byname): Fix missing auto_key_retrieve
	unlock.  Fix strings to not start with a capital letter as per
	convention.

2006-03-30  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* main.h, seskey.c (encode_md_value): Modify to allow a q size
	greater than 160 bits as per DSA2.  This will allow us to verify
	and issue DSA2 signatures for some backwards compatibility once we
	start generating DSA2 keys.
	* sign.c (do_sign), sig-check.c (do_check): Change all callers.

	* sign.c (do_sign): Enforce the 160-bit check for new signatures
	here since encode_md_value can handle non-160-bit digests now.
	This will need to come out once the standard for DSA2 is firmed
	up.

2006-03-28  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* openfile.c (overwrite_filep): Fix small cpr issue.  Noted by
	Daiki Ueno.

2006-03-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* getkey.c (parse_auto_key_locate): Silently strip out duplicates
	rather than causing an error.

2006-03-22  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* sig-check.c (signature_check2): Changed warning URL to include faq.
	* misc.c (idea_cipher_warn): Ditto.

2006-03-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* mainproc.c (get_pka_address): Fix bug introduced as part of
	sig_to_notation conversion.  Noted by Peter Palfradrer.

2006-03-21  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* cardglue.c (agent_scd_pksign): Allow the use of ripemd-160 along
	with scdaemon.

2006-03-16  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_import_cert): Handle the IPGP CERT type
	for both the fingerprint alone, and fingerprint+URL cases.

	* getkey.c (get_pubkey_byname): Minor cleanup.

2006-03-13  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver-internal.h, keyserver.c (keyserver_import_pka): Use
	the same API as the other auto-key-locate fetchers.

	* getkey.c (get_pubkey_byname): Use the fingerprint of the key
	that we actually fetched.  This helps prevent problems where the
	key that we fetched doesn't have the same name that we used to
	fetch it.  In the case of CERT and PKA, this is an actual security
	requirement as the URL might point to a key put in by an attacker.
	By forcing the use of the fingerprint, we won't use the attacker's
	key here.

	* keyserver-internal.h, keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn,
	keyserver_work, keyserver_import_cert, keyserver_import_name,
	keyserver_import_ldap): Pass fingerprint info through.

	* main.h, import.c (import_one): Optionally return the fingerprint
	of the key being imported.
	(import_keys_internal, import_keys_stream, import): Change all
	callers.

2006-03-12  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* sig-check.c (signature_check2): Print the backsig warning when

	* keyedit.c (menu_backsign): Small tweak to work properly with
	keys originally generated with older GnuPGs that included comments
	in the secret keys.

	* card-util.c (get_manufacturer): Added Vendor 3

2006-03-09  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* build-packet.c (string_to_notation): Add ability to indicate a
	notation to be deleted with a '-' prefix.

	* keyedit.c (menu_set_notation): Use it here to allow deleting a
	notation marked with '-'.  This works with either "-notation" or
	"-notation=value".

2006-03-08  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (menu_set_notation): New function to set notations on
	self-signatures.
	(keyedit_menu): Call it here.
	(tty_print_notations): Helper.
	(show_prefs): Show notations in "showpref".

	* mainproc.c (get_pka_address)
	* keylist.c (show_notation): Remove
	duplicate code by using notation functions.

	* packet.h, build-packet.c (sig_to_notation)
	* keygen.c (keygen_add_notations): Provide printable text for
	non-human-readable notation values.

	* packet.h, build-packet.c (sig_to_notation)

	* packet.h, main.h, keygen.c (keygen_add_notations)
	* build-packet.c (string_to_notation, sig_to_notation)
	(free_notation): New "one stop shopping" functions to handle
	notations and start removing some code duplication.

2006-03-08  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* mainproc.c (do_check_sig): Use log_error for standalone revocations.

2006-03-07  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print), gpg.c (main):
	pka-lookups, not pka-lookup.

	* options.h, gpg.c (main), keyedit.c [cmds], sig-check.c
	(signature_check2): Rename "backsign" to "cross-certify" as a more
	accurate name.

	* options.h, gpg.c (main, parse_trust_model), pkclist.c
	(check_signatures_trust), mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print,
	pka_uri_from_sig), trustdb.c (init_trustdb): Some tweaks to PKA so
	that it is a verify-option now.

2006-03-07  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* mainproc.c (proc_signature_packets): Return any_sig_seen to caller.
	(check_sig_and_print): Option to partly allow the old behaviour.
	* gpg.c: New option --allow-multisig-verification.

2006-03-06  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* sign.c (make_keysig_packet): Don't use MD5 for a RSA_S key as
	that is not a PGP 2.x algorithm.

	* mainproc.c (proc_compressed): "Uncompressed" is not a valid
	compression algorithm.

2006-03-06  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print): Made the composition test more
	tight.  This is due to another bug report by Tavis Ormandy.
	(add_onepass_sig): Simplified.

2006-03-05  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* plaintext.c (handle_plaintext): Replace assert by explict error
	conflict message.  Reported by Tavis Ormandy.

2006-03-02  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* cardglue.c (check_card_serialno): Don't ask in batch mode.

2006-03-01  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* getkey.c (parse_auto_key_locate): Error if the user selects
	"cert" or "pka" when those features are disabled.

	* misc.c (has_invalid_email_chars): Fix some C syntax that broke
	the compilers on SGI IRIX MIPS and Compaq/DEC OSF/1 Alpha.  Noted
	by Nelson H. F. Beebe.

2006-02-27  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.skel: Document auto-key-locate and give a pointer to
	Simon Josefsson's page for CERT.

2006-02-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keydb.h, getkey.c (release_akl), gpg.c (main): Add
	--no-auto-key-locate.

	* options.h, gpg.c (main): Keep track of each keyserver registered
	so we can match on them later.

	* keyserver-internal.h, keyserver.c (cmp_keyserver_spec,
	keyserver_match), gpgv.c: New.  Find a keyserver that matches ours
	and return its spec.

	* getkey.c (get_pubkey_byname): Use it here to get the
	per-keyserver options from an earlier keyserver.

2006-02-23  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_options): Only change max_cert if
	it is used.

	* options.c, gpg.c (main), keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): No
	special treatment of include-revoked, include-subkeys, and
	try-dns-srv.  These are keyserver features, and GPG shouldn't get
	involved here.

	* keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_uri, add_canonical_option): Always
	append options to the list, as ordering may be significant to the
	user.

	* gpg.c (add_notation_data): Fix reversed logic for isascii check
	when adding notations.  Noted by Christian Biere.

	* options.h, keyserver.c (add_canonical_option): New.
	(parse_keyserver_options): Moved from here.
	(parse_keyserver_uri): Use it here so each keyserver can have some
	private options in addition to the main keyserver-options
	(e.g. per-keyserver auth).

2006-02-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, keyserver-internal.h, keyserver.c
	(keyserver_import_name), getkey.c (free_akl,
	parse_auto_key_locate, get_pubkey_byname): The obvious next step:
	allow arbitrary keyservers in the auto-key-locate list.

	* options.h, keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_options): Remove
	auto-cert-retrieve as it is no longer meaningful.  Add
	max-cert-size to allow users to pick a max key size retrieved via
	CERT.

	* options.h, gpg.c (main), mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print),
	keyserver.c (keyserver_opts): Rename auto-pka-retrieve to
	honor-pka-record to be consistent with honor-keyserver-url.

	* options.h, keydb.h, g10.c (main), getkey.c
	(parse_auto_key_locate): Parse a list of key access methods.
	(get_pubkey_byname): Walk the list here to try and retrieve keys
	we don't have locally.

2006-02-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* getkey.c (get_pubkey_byname): Fix minor security problem with
	PKA when importing at -r time.  The URL in the PKA record may
	point to a key put in by an attacker.  Fix is to use the
	fingerprint from the PKA record as the recipient.  This ensures
	that the PKA record is followed.

	* keyserver-internal.h, keyserver.c (keyserver_import_pka): Return
	the fingerprint we requested.

	* gpgv.c: Stub keyserver_import_ldap.

	* keyserver-internal.h, keyserver.c (keyserver_import_ldap):
	Import using the PGP Universal trick of asking
	ldap://keys.(maildomain) for the key.

2006-02-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_uri): Include the scheme in the uri
	even when we've assumed "hkp" when there was no scheme.

2006-02-20  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* apdu.c (open_pcsc_reader): As a precaution set LIST to NULL
	after free.

2006-02-14  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* verify.c (verify_signatures): Print warning also for NO_DATA.

	* mainproc.c (struct mainproc_context): New field any_sig_seen.
	(add_signature): Set it.
	(proc_signature_packets): Test and return NO_DATA.

2006-02-09  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* gpg.c (main) <oLockNever>: Disable random locking.

2006-02-06  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* ccid-driver.h (CCID_DRIVER_ERR_NO_KEYPAD): New.
	* ccid-driver.c (send_escape_cmd): New args RESULT, RESULTLEN and
	RESULTMAX.  Changed all callers.
	(ccid_transceive_escape): New.

	(bulk_out, bulk_in): Add support for CardMan 4040 reader.
	* ccid-driver.c (scan_or_find_devices): Factored most code out to
	(scan_or_find_usb_device): .. new.
	(make_reader_id): Fixed vendor mask.

2006-01-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_uri): If there is a path present,
	set the direct_uri flag so the right keyserver helper is run.

2006-01-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Include the EXEEXT so we can find
	keyserver helpers on systems that use extensions.

	* misc.c (path_access) [HAVE_DRIVE_LETTERS]: Do the right thing
	with drive letter systems.

2006-01-17  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keydb.h, passphrase.c (next_to_last_passphrase): New.  "Touch" a
	passphrase as if it was used (move from next_pw to last_pw).

	* pubkey-enc.c (get_session_key): Use it here to handle the case
	where a passphrase happens to be correct for a secret key, but yet
	that key isn't the anonymous recipient (i.e. the secret key could
	be decrypted, but not the session key).  This also handles the
	case where a secret key is located on a card and a secret key with
	no passphrase.  Note this does not fix bug 594 (anonymous
	recipients on smartcard do not work) - it just prevents the
	anonymous search from stopping when the card is encountered.

2006-01-07  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_refresh): Fix problem when more than one
	key in a refresh batch has a preferred keyserver set.  Noted by
	Nicolas Rachinsky.

2006-01-01  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print), keyserver.c
	(keyserver_import_pka), card-util.c (fetch_url): Always require a
	scheme:// for keyserver URLs except when used as part of the
	--keyserver command for backwards compatibility.

	* sign.c (write_signature_packets): Lost a digest_algo line.

	* sign.c (hash_for): Add code to detect if the sk lives on a smart
	card.  If it does, only allow 160-bit hashes, a la DSA.  This
	involves passing the *sk in, so change all callers.  This is
	correct for today, given the current 160-bit q in DSA, and the
	current SHA-1/RIPEMD160 support in the openpgp card.  It will
	almost certainly need changing down the road.

	* app-openpgp.c (do_sign): Give user error if hash algorithm is
	not supported by the card.

2005-12-23  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_import_pka): New.  Moved from
	getkey.c:get_pubkey_byname which was getting crowded.

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_import_cert): Import a key found in DNS
	via CERT records.  Can handle both the PGP (actual key) and IPGP
	(URL) CERT types.

	* getkey.c (get_pubkey_byname): Call them both here.

	* options.h, keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_options): Add
	"auto-cert-retrieve" option with optional max size argument.

	* gpgv.c: Stubs.

	* keyserver-internal.h, keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn,
	keyserver_work, keygerver_getname): New keyserver_getname function
	to fetch keys by name.

	* getkey.c (get_pubkey_byname): Call it here to enable locating
	keys by full mailbox from a keyserver a la PKA.  Try PKA first,
	though, as it is likely to be faster.

2005-12-20  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* gpg.c: New option --allow-pka-lookup.
	(parse_trust_model): Add "+pka" variants.
	(main): Make KEYSERVER_AUTO_PKA_RETRIEVE teh default.
	* options.h (opt): New fields PKA_TRUST_INCREASE and
	ALLOW_PKA_LOOKUP.
	* status.h (STATUS_PKA_TRUST_BAD, STATUS_PKA_TRUST_GOOD): New.
	* pkclist.c (check_signatures_trust): Increase trust due to valid
	PKA only if that new option has been set.  Issue new status lines.
	* trustdb.c (init_trustdb): Print info if this option is active.
	* getkey.c (get_pubkey_byname): Honor allow-pka-lookup.
	* mainproc.c (pka_uri_from_sig): Ditto.

	* trustdb.c (validate_keys): Print no "ultimately trusted keys
	found" only in non-quiet mode.

2005-12-19  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main): All primary keys can certify.

2005-12-18  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpg.c (main): Restore convert-sk-to-pk as programs rely on it.

	* keyid.c (usagestr_from_pk): Remove special PUBKEY_USAGE_CERT
	flag.  It's no longer needed.

2005-12-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpg.c (main): Don't default to import-options convert-sk-to-pk.
	It causes confusing warning messages when importing a PGP-exported
	key that contains a secret key without selfsigs followed by the
	public key.

2005-12-08  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_fetch): Switch on fast-import before we
	--fetch-keys so we don't rebuild the trustdb after each fetch.

2005-12-08  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* gpg.c (main): Check for DBCS lead byte when converting the
	homedir.  By Kazuyoshi Kakihara. Fixes PR561.

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_fetch): Made strings translatable.

2005-12-08  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, keyserver.c (curl_cant_handle, keyserver_spawn)
	(keyserver_fetch): Set a flag to indicate that we're doing a direct
	URI fetch so we can differentiate between a keyserver operation
	and a URI fetch for protocols like LDAP that can do either.

2005-12-07  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Don't print "searching for key
	00000000" when fetching a URI.

	* keyserver-internal.h, keyserver.c (keyserver_fetch): New.  Fetch
	an arbitrary URI using the keyserver helpers.

	* gpg.c (main): Call it from here for --fetch-keys.

2005-12-07  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* pkclist.c (do_we_trust): Add NOTREACHED comment.

2005-11-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* main.h, keylist.c (print_revokers): New.  Print the "rvk"
	designated revoker record.  Moved from
	keyedit.c:show_key_with_all_names_colon.

	* keylist.c (list_keyblock_colon): Use it here ...

	* keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names_colon): ... and here.

2005-11-19  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* free-packet.c (copy_secret_key): Copy secret key into secure
	memory since we may unprotect it.

	* main.h, g10.c (main), revoke.c (gen_desig_revoke): Add local
	user support so users can use -u with --desig-revoke.  This
	bypasses the interactive walk over the revocation keys.

2005-11-17  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu, menu_clean): Simplify clean options to
	just "clean", and add "minimize".

	* import.c (parse_import_options): Make help text match the export
	versions of the options.

	* options.h, export.c (parse_export_options, do_export_stream):
	Reduce clean options to two: clean and minimize.

	* trustdb.h, trustdb.c (clean_one_uid): New function that joins
	uid and sig cleaning into one for a simple API outside trustdb.

2005-11-13  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* armor.c (parse_header_line): A fussy bit of 2440: header lines
	are delimited with a colon-space pair.  Therefore a line such as
	"Comment: " (with a trailing space) is actually legal, albeit not
	particularly useful.

2005-11-11  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* trustdb.h, trustdb.c (clean_key): New function to handle key
	cleaning from one convenient place.

	* options.h, import.c (parse_import_options,
	clean_sigs_from_all_uids, import_one): Reduce clean options to
	two: clean and minimize.

	* parse-packet.c (setup_user_id): Remove.
	(parse_user_id, parse_attribute): Just use xmalloc_clear instead.

	* trustdb.c (clean_uid_from_key, clean_uids_from_key):
	Significantly simpler implementation.

2005-11-10  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu, menu_clean_sigs_from_uids): Add
	"minimize" command.

	* packet.h, keyedit.c (menu_clean_uids_from_key), trustdb.c
	(clean_uids_from_key): Fix display bug where sigs cleaned for
	other reasons caused a uid to appear as if it had been compacted.

	* packet.h: Move some flags to a bitfield.  Change all callers.

	* options.h, import.c (parse_import_options,
	clean_sigs_from_all_uids, import_one): Add import-minimal option.
	Similar to export-minimal, except it works on the way in.

	* trustdb.h, trustdb.c (clean_sigs_from_uid): Add flag to remove
	all non-selfsigs from key during cleaning.  Change all callers.

	* export.c (do_export_stream): Use it here for export-minimal so
	we don't need additional minimize code in the export path.

2005-11-06  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.skel: Add a section for --encrypt-to.  This is Debian
	bug 336211 by Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña.

2005-11-05  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am: Include @LIBUSB_CPPFLAGS@ in our CPPFLAGS.
	Strictly speaking this should be only in gpg_CPPFLAGS, but then we
	have to compile everything twice for gpg and gpgv.

	* apdu.c (open_pcsc_reader): Fix double free.

	* gpg.c (main) [__APPLE__]: Default the PCSC driver to the OS X
	location.  Suggested by Patty A. Hardy.

2005-11-02  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* trustdb.c (clean_sigs_from_uid): Include sigs from unavailable
	keys in the sigs that are cleaned.  Suggested by Dirk Traulsen and
	many others.

2005-11-01  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* import.c (import_one): Do collapse_uids() before we do any
	cleaning so keyserver mangled keys with doubled user IDs can be
	properly cleaned - possibly sigs on the different user IDs cancel
	each other out.

	* import.c (parse_import_options), export.c
	(parse_export_options): List "xxx-clean" before the longer options
	so we don't end up with a partial match on the longer options.

	* trustdb.c (clean_uids_from_key): Return proper number of cleaned
	user IDs.  Don't count user IDs as cleaned unless we actually
	delete something.

2005-10-27  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (menu_addrevoker), getkey.c (finish_lookup): Fix
	problem with adding a cert-only designated revoker.  Code was
	looking for a key with sign ability, and not cert ability.  Noted
	by Timo Schulz.

2005-10-27  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* gpg.c [__CYGWIN__]: Set default driver to winscard.dll.

	* apdu.c, apdu.h: Updated from gnupg 1.9.  Changes are:

	(check_ccid_keypad): New.
	(apdu_check_keypad): New.
	(apdu_send_le): Factored all code out to ...
	(send_le): .. new.  Takes an additional arg; changed all callers
	of the orginal function to use this one with a NULL for the new
	arg.
	(apdu_send_simple_kp): New.
	(ct_send_apdu, pcsc_send_apdu, my_rapdu_send_apdu)
	(send_apdu_ccid): New arg PININFO.
	(send_apdu_ccid): Use the new arg.

2005-10-26  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (proc_parameter_file): Default key and subkey usage
	flags to algo capabilities if parameter file doesn't specify them.
	Noted by Timo Schulz.

2005-10-18  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* cardglue.c (pin_cb): Fixed prompt for repeated PIN.  Return
	G10ERR_CANCELED and not just -1.
	(status_sc_op_failure): New.  Use it where we issue that status.
	(pin_cb): Append serial number to the need-pin status message.
	(agent_scd_change_pin): Add arg SERIALNO.  Changed all callers.
	(agent_scd_writekey): Ditto.
	(agent_scd_setattr): Ditto.
	(agent_scd_genkey): Ditto.
	(agent_scd_checkpin): Pass serialno to the pin_cb.

	* keygen.c (parse_expire_string): Allow setting the expire
	interval using a "seconds=<n>" syntax.  This is useful for
	debugging.

2005-10-17  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* export.c (do_export_stream): Factored some code out to ...
	(skip_subkey_p): .. new.
	(subkey_in_list_p, release_subkey_list): New.
	(new_subkey_list_item): New.
	(do_export_stream): Export exactly specified subkeys into one
	keyblock.

2005-10-13  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu, menu_backsign): New "backsign" command
	to add 0x19 backsigs to old keys that don't have them.

	* misc.c (parse_options): Fix build warning.

	* main.h, keygen.c (make_backsig): Make public.

2005-10-12  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_subkey), gpg.c (main),
	sig-check.c (signature_check2): Add --require-backsigs and
	--no-require-backsigs.  Currently defaults to
	--no-require-backsigs.

2005-10-11  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_subkey), sig-check.c
	(signature_check2), keygen.c (make_backsig): Did some backsig
	interop testing with the PGP folks.  All is well, so I'm turning
	generation of backsigs on for new keys.  Checking for backsigs on
	verification is still off.

2005-10-05  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* g10.c: Renamed to ..
	* gpg.c: ..this.
	* Makefile.am: Adjusted accordingly.

2005-09-22  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* sign.c (write_plaintext_packet): Don't print an empty file
	warning if the file is actually too large.
	* encode.c (encode_simple,encode_crypt): Ditto.
	* progress.c (handle_progress): Adjusted for iobuf_get_filelength
	change.
	* photoid.c (generate_photo_id): Ditto.

2005-09-20  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	attribute IDs as well as regular text IDs.

	* plaintext.c (ask_for_detached_datafile): Use make_filename() on
	filename so tilde expansion works.

2005-09-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* main.h, misc.c (parse_options): Add the ability to have help
	strings in xxx-options commands.

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_opts), import.c (parse_import_options),
	export.c (parse_export_options), g10.c (parse_list_options, main):
	Add help strings to xxx-options.

2005-09-10  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (show_names): Moved name display code out from
	show_key_with_all_names.
	(keyedit_menu): Call it here for pref and showpref so they can
	show only the selected user ID.  Suggested by Timo Schulz.

2005-09-07  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* cardglue.h (GPG_ERR_TOO_LARGE): New.

	* apdu.c, apdu.h, iso7816.c, iso7816.h

	* misc.c (parse_options): Allow meta option "help" to list all
	options and to exit the program.

2005-09-02  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* parse-packet.c (enum_sig_subpkt, parse_signature,
	parse_attribute_subpkts): Make a number of warnings verbose items.
	These fire on many slightly mangled keys in the field, so the
	warning is becoming burdensome.

2005-09-01  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* photoid.h, photoid.c (generate_photo_id): Allow passing in a
	suggested filename.

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu, menu_adduid): Call it here so "addphoto
	filename" works.

2005-08-31  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* photoid.c (generate_photo_id): Enable readline completion and
	tilde expansion for the JPEG prompt.

2005-08-30  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* passphrase.c (agent_open): Print a warning and not an error in
	case of a missing agent.  Should fix Debian bug #325578.

2005-08-26  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* misc.c (openpgp_pk_algo_usage): Default to allowing CERT for
	signing algorithms.

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids): Don't request a signing key to make a
	certification.

	* keygen.c (do_add_key_flags): Force the certify flag on for all
	primary keys, as the spec requires primary keys must be able to
	certify (if nothing else, which key is going to issue the user ID
	signature?)
	(print_key_flags): Show certify flag.
	(ask_key_flags, ask_algo): Don't allow setting the C flag for
	subkeys.

	* keyid.c (usagestr_from_pk), getkey.c (parse_key_usage):
	Distinguish between a sign/certify key and a certify-only key.

	* keyedit.c (ask_revoke_sig): Add a revsig --with-colons mode.
	Suggested by Michael Schierl.

2005-08-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am: No need to link with curl any longer.

	* main.h, misc.c (path_access): New.  Same as access() but does a
	PATH search like execlp.

	* keyserver.c (curl_can_handle): Removed.  Replaced by...
	(curl_cant_handle): We are now relying on curl as the handler of
	last resort.  This is necessary because PGP LDAP and curl LDAP are
	apples and oranges.
	(keyserver_typemap): Only test for ldap and ldaps.
	(keyserver_spawn): If a given handler is unusable (as determined
	by path_access()) then try gpgkeys_curl.

	* exec.h, exec.c (make_tempdir, expand_args, exec_write,
	exec_read): Minor cleanup to use bitfield flags instead of a bunch
	of integers.

2005-08-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (main): Add aliases sign-with->local-user and
	user->recipient to make switching from PGP command line to GPG
	easier.

2005-08-19  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.skel: Remove the surfnet LDAP keyserver from the list of
	samples since it is being shut down.

	* getkey.c (classify_user_id): Disable the '.' and '+' search
	modes since they aren't supported yet.

2005-08-05  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (main), passphrase.c (set_passphrase_from_string): New
	--passphrase command line option.  Only useful in very special
	circumstances.

2005-08-05  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* gpgv.c (keyserver_import_fprint): New stub.

	* keygen.c (ask_user_id): Moved email checking code out to ..
	* misc.c (is_valid_mailbox): .. new.
	* mainproc.c (get_pka_address): Use it here.
	* getkey.c (get_pubkey_byname): Add falback to auto-retrieve a key
	via the PKA mechanism.

	* options.h (KEYSERVER_AUTO_PKA_RETRIEVE): New.
	* keyserver.c (keyserver_opts): Ditto.
	* mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print): Use it here to retrieve keys
	from a PKA DNS record.

	* pkclist.c (build_pk_list): Add comments to this function;
	re-indented it.

2005-08-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (proc_parameter_file): Sanity check items in keygen
	batch file.  Noted by Michael Schierl.

	* pkclist.c (do_edit_ownertrust): Don't allow ownertrust level 0.
	Noted by Michael Schierl.

	* keygen.c (write_keyblock): Don't try and build deleted kbnodes
	since we start our tree with one.

2005-08-04  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* export.c (do_export_stream): Skip on-card keys when only subkeys
	are to be exported.  It does not make sense to replace the on-card
	key stub by a no-key stub.

	* revoke.c (gen_revoke): Check for non-online keys.

	* seckey-cert.c (is_secret_key_protected): Return -3 for
	non-online key stubs.  The old code assumes that a protection
	algorithm is still set but in some cases this one is 0 and thus it
	won't be possible to decide whether it is unprotected or
	protected.

2005-07-28  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* Makefile.am (other_libs): Add SRVLIBS.

	* parse-packet.c (can_handle_critical_notation): We know about
	pka-address@gnupg.org.
	* packet.h (PKT_signature): New fields PKA_INFO and PKA_TRIED.
	(pka_info_t): New.
	* free-packet.c (cp_pka_info): New.
	(free_seckey_enc, copy_signature): Support new fields.
	* mainproc.c (get_pka_address, pka_uri_from_sig): New.
	(check_sig_and_print): Try to get the keyserver from the PKA
	record.
	* pkclist.c (check_signatures_trust): Adjust the trust based on
	the PKA.
	* gpgv.c (parse_keyserver_uri): New stub.

	* keygen.c (has_invalid_email_chars): Moved to ..
	* misc.c (has_invalid_email_chars): .. here and made global.

2005-07-27  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* export.c (do_export_stream): Make two strings translatable.

2005-07-26  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_typemap): Special-case LDAP since curl
	will report that it can handle it, and we don't want it to.

2005-07-26  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* passphrase.c (agent_get_passphrase): Make sure to release the
	saved codeset.
	(agent_open): Add arg ORIG_CODESET and switch back to it in case
	of error.  Changed all callers.

2005-07-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids): Don't prompt for setting signature expiry
	to match key expiry unless --ask-cert-expire is set.  Suggested by
	Peter Palfrader.

2005-07-22  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* g10.c, options.h: New option --exit-on-status-write-error.
	* status.c (write_status_text): Make use of this option.

2005-07-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main): Removed option --no-interactive-selection.
	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu): Use --interactive to enable the uid
	walking when signing a key with no uids specified to sign.

	* keylist.c (list_keyblock_print): Fix silly typo.  Noted by Greg
	Sabino Mullane.

2005-07-20  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* openfile.c (open_outfile): Disable FD caching for created files.
	* encode.c (encode_simple, encode_crypt): Disable FD caching for
	input files.
	* verify.c (verify_one_file): Ditto.
	* decrypt.c (decrypt_messages): Ditto. This is bug #479.

	* misc.c (get_libexecdir) [W32]: Changed to return the value of
	program used to create the process.
	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn) [DISABLE_KEYSERVER_PATH]: Don't
	change the exec-path at all.

2005-07-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (curl_can_handle): New.  Do a runtime check against
	libcurl to see if it can handle a particular protocol.
	(keyserver_typemap): Call it here.

	* Makefile.am: Pull in libcurl for curl_version_info() if used.

2005-07-19  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* g10.c, options.h: New option --limit-card-insert-tries.
	* cardglue.c (open_card): Use it.

	* export.c (parse_export_options): New option
	export-reset-subkey-passwd.
	(do_export_stream): Implement it.

	* misc.c (get_libexecdir): New.
	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Use it

2005-07-18  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* tdbio.c (open_db): Check for EROFS.  Suggested by Bryce Nichols.

2005-07-08  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* trustdb.c (clean_uids_from_key): Don't keep a valid selfsig
	around when compacting a uid.  There is no reason to make an
	attacker's job easier - this way they only have a revocation which
	is useless in bringing the uid back.

	* keydb.h, kbnode.c (undelete_kbnode): Removed.  No longer needed.

	* import.c (chk_self_sigs): Allow a uid revocation to be enough to
	allow importing a particular uid (no self sig needed).  This
	allows importing compacted uids.

2005-06-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (save_unprotected_key_to_card): Better fix for gcc4
	warning.

2005-06-20  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* g10.c, options.h: New option --no-interactive-selection.
	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu): Use it.

2005-06-18  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* parse-packet.c (parse_signature): Use log_info for messages
	about missing timestamp or keyid.  In case we don't use that key
	there won't be no further error and thus gpg does not need to
	return with an error.

2005-06-13  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (save_unprotected_key_to_card): Fix gcc4 warning.

	* options.h, import.c (parse_import_options, import_one): Add
	import-clean-uids option to automatically compact unusable uids
	when importing.  Like import-clean-sigs, this may nodify the local
	keyring.

	* trustdb.c (clean_uids_from_key): Only allow selfsigs to be a
	candidate for re-inclusion.

2005-06-12  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, import.c (parse_import_options,
	clean_sigs_from_all_uids, import_one): Add import-clean-sigs
	option to automatically clean a key when importing.  Note that
	when importing a key that is already on the local keyring, the
	clean applies to the merged key - i.e. existing superceded or
	invalid signatures are removed.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main, merge_selfsigs_subkey): Make sure
	that even after keys may be merged together, we only have one
	chosen selfsig.

2005-06-09  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, import.c (parse_import_options, delete_inv_parts):
	import-unusable-sigs is now a noop.

	* options.h, export.c (do_export_stream), keyedit.c (keyedit_menu,
	menu_clean_subkeys_from_key), trustdb.h, trustdb.c
	(clean_subkeys_from_key): Remove subkey cleaning function.  It is
	of very limited usefulness since it cannot be used on any subkey
	that can sign, and can only affect multiple selfsigs on
	encryption-only subkeys.

	* keydb.h, kbnode.c (undelete_kbnode): New function to undelete a
	kbnode.

	* trustdb.c (clean_uids_from_key): Further tweak the algorithm so
	that the last good selfsig is kept when the chosen selfsig is a
	revocation.

2005-06-08  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* trustdb.c (clean_uids_from_key), keyedit.c
	(menu_clean_uids_from_key): Tweak algorithm to preserve the last
	selfsig which helps prevent uid resurrections.

	* getkey.c (fixup_uidnode, merge_selfsigs_main): Handle both
	expired and revoked uids in fixup_uidnode().  No need to special
	case in merge_selfsigs_main().  This also means that an expired
	uid will have its selfsig tagged with chosen_selfsig.

2005-06-07  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main), export.c (parse_export_options,
	do_export_stream): Add export-options export-clean-sigs,
	export-clean-uids, export-clean-subkeys, and export-clean which is
	all of the above.  Export-minimal is the same except it also
	removes all non-selfsigs.  export-unusable-sigs is now a noop.

2005-06-06  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* cardglue.c (open_card): Emit new CARDCTRL status 5 for no reader
	available.

2005-06-02  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* app-openpgp.c (do_writekey): Typo fix.

	* status.c, status.h: Removed STATUS_BAD_PASSPHRASE_PIN.

2005-06-01  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* signal.c [HAVE_DOSISH_SYSTEM]: Fix unused function warnings on
	mingw32.  Noted by Joe Vender.

	* passphrase.c [_WIN32]: Remove unused variables.

2005-05-31  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (menu_clean_uids_from_key,
	menu_clean_subkeys_from_key), trustdb.c (clean_uids_from_key,
	clean_subkeys_from_key): Fix mingw32 build warnings.  Noted by Joe
	Vender.

2005-05-31  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* keydb.h [!ENABLE_AGENT_SUPPORT]: Define dummy types.

	* cardglue.c (assuan_strerror, assuan_transact): Dummy functions
	if not build with agent support.

	* armor.c (check_input): Don't bail out on invalid header lines
	unless in struict rfc2440 mode.  Suggested by Richard Patterson.

2005-05-30  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* tlv.c: Add hack to compile without gpg-error.h.

2005-05-30  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* trustdb.h, trustdb.c (clean_subkeys_from_key): New.  Walk
	through the subkeys on a key, and mark any that aren't usable for
	deletion.  Note that a signing subkey is never marked for deletion
	since these keys are still useful after expiration or revocation.

	* keyedit.c (menu_clean_subkeys_from_key): New function to call
	clean_subkeys_from_key() on a key.  Note that the strings here are
	not marked for translation yet.  The UI is still in flux, and
	there is no point in annoying the translators twice.
	(keyedit_menu): Call it here as part of the "clean" command.

2005-05-29  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* trustdb.h, trustdb.c (clean_uids_from_key): New.  Walk through
	the user IDs on a key, and mark any that aren't valid for
	deletion.

	* keyedit.c (menu_clean_uids_from_key): New function to call
	clean_uids_from_key() on a key.
	(keyedit_menu): Call it from here as part of the "clean" command.

2005-05-26  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (main): Default {export|import}-unusable-sigs to off until
	the "clean" UI can be finished.

2005-05-24  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* passphrase.c (ask_passphrase): Unescape the description string.

	* cardglue.c (open_card): Check USE_AGENT.
	(agent_scd_checkpin): Implemented Assuan part.
	(agent_scd_change_pin): Ditto.

	* g10.c (main): Option --debug-ccid-driver may now be given
	several times increase the debug level.

	* ccid-driver.c (parse_ccid_descriptor): Mark SCR335 FW version
	5.14 as good.
	(do_close_reader): Never do a reset. The caller should instead
	make sure that the reader has been closed properly.  The new retry
	code in ccid_slot_status will make sure that the readersatrts up
	fine even if the last process didn't closed the USB connection
	properly.
	(ccid_get_atr): For certain readers try switching to ISO mode.
	Thanks to Ludovic Rousseau for this hint and the magic numbers.
	(print_command_failed): New.
	(bulk_in): Use it here. Add new arg NO_DEBUG.
	(ccid_slot_status): Disabled debugging.

	(agent_openpgp_storekey): Removed.
	* cardglue.h: Add a few more error code mappings.
	* keygen.c (copy_mpi): Removed.
	(save_unprotected_key_to_card): Changed to use agent_scd_writekey.
	* app-common.h, app-openpgp.c, tlv.c, tlv.h: Updated from newer
	version in gnupg 1.9 CVS.

2005-05-20  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* ccid-driver.c (ccid_transceive): Arghhh.  The seqno is another
	bit in the R-block than in the I block, this was wrong at one
	place. Fixes bug #419 and hopefully several others.

2005-05-19  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* app-common.h, app-openpgp.c, tlv.c, tlv.h: Updated from newer
	version in gnupg 1.9 CVS.

2005-05-18  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	--no-sk-comments options, and replace with no-op.

2005-05-11  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (write_selfsigs): Rename from write_selfsig.  Write the
	same selfsig into both the pk and sk, so that someone importing
	their sk (which will get an autoconvert to the pk) won't end up
	with two selfsigs.
	(do_generate_keypair): Call it from here.

	* parse-packet.c (can_handle_critical_notation): New.  Check for
	particular notation tags that we will accept when critical.
	Currently, that's only preferred-email-encoding@pgp.com, since we
	know how to handle it (pass it through to a mail program).
	(can_handle_critical): Call it from here.
	(parse_one_sig_subpkt): Sanity check that notations are
	well-formed in that the internal lengths add up to the size of the
	subpacket.

2005-05-07  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* ccid-driver.c (do_close_reader): Don't do a reset before close.
	Some folks reported that it makes the SCR335 hang less often.
	Look at the source on how to re-enable it.

2005-05-06  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* main.h, keygen.c (parse_expire_string, ask_expire_interval),
	sign.c (sign_file, clearsign_file, sign_symencrypt_file), g10.c
	(main), keyedit.c (sign_uids): Use seconds rather than days
	internally to calculate expiration.  We no longer need the
	day-based code as we don't generate v3 keys.

	* sign.c (sign_file, clearsign_file, sign_symencrypt_file): Use
	the default sig expire value when signing in batchmode.

2005-05-05  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am, packet.h, main.h, comment.c: Remove comment.c.  We
	don't use any of these functions any longer.

	* keygen.c (start_tree): New function to "prime" a KBNODE list.
	(do_generate_keypair): Use it here rather than creating and
	deleting a comment packet.

	* keygen.c (gen_elg, gen_dsa): Do not put public factors in secret
	key as a comment.

	* options.h, encode.c (encode_simple, encode_crypt), keygen.c
	(do_create): Remove disabled comment packet code.

	* keygen.c (keygen_set_std_prefs): Add SHA256 and BZip2 to default
	preferences.

	* options.h, g10.c (main): Add new --default-sig-expire and
	--default-cert-expire options.  Suggested by Florian Weimer.

	* main.h, keygen.c (parse_expire_string, ask_expire_interval): Use
	defaults passed in, or "0" to control what default expiration is.

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids), sign.c (sign_file, clearsign_file,
	sign_symencrypt_file): Call them here, so that default expiration
	is used when --ask-xxxxx-expire is off.

2005-05-03  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* passphrase.c (agent_get_passphrase): Add new arg CACHEID.

	"clean" command that removes unusable sigs from a key.

	* trustdb.h, keyedit.c (keyedit_menu, menu_select_uid_namehash):
	Allow specifying user ID via the namehash from --with-colons
	--fixed-list-mode --list-keys.  Suggested by Peter Palfrader.

2005-04-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids, keyedit_menu): When the user requests to
	sign a key without specifying which user IDs to sign, and declines
	to sign all user IDs, walk through the set of user IDs and prompt
	for which to sign.

	* mainproc.c (symkey_decrypt_seskey): There is no need to have an
	extra check for a bad passphrase and/or unknown cipher algorithm
	here.  We'll fail quite happily later, and usually with a better
	error message to boot.

2005-04-20  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

2005-03-31  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* exec.h, exec.c (set_exec_path): Remove some dead code and change
	all callers.  We no longer need to append to $PATH.

2005-03-31  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* passphrase.c (agent_open): Dropped support for W32 - is was
	never actually used.  Removed support for the old non-assuan
	protocol; there has never been a matured implementation and
	gpg-agent is now arround for quite some time.  Rewritten to make
	use of the Assuan code from ../util.
	(gpga_protocol_codes): Removed.
	(readn): Removed.
	(agent_close): Simplified for use with Assuan.
	(agent_get_passphrase, passphrase_clear_cache): Removed support
	for old protocol.  Use only with ENABLE_CARD_SUPPORT defined.

	descriptor.
	(agent_send_option): Likewise. Use assuan_transact.
	* passphrase.c (writen, readaline): Removed.

	* g10.c (main): Print a warning if --use-agent has been used but
	it has not been build with support for it.

	* keydb.c (keydb_add_resource): Clarify meaning of flags.  Add new
	flag 4.  Use log_info for errors registering the default secret key.
	* g10.c (main): Flag the default keyrings.

2005-03-30  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Don't mess about with the $PATH.
	Rather, call keyserver helpers with the full path.  This fixes
	some PATH-inspired DLL problems on W32.  Noted by Carlo Luciano
	Bianco.

2005-03-30  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* cardglue.c (pin_cb): Print a warning if the info string hack is
	not there.  This may happen due to typos in the translation.

2005-03-22  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* misc.c (w32_shgetfolderpath) [W32]: Changed declaration of
	function ptr.  Noted by Tim Costello.
	* apdu.c [W32]: Changed	declaration of dlopened function pointers.

2005-03-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	prompting for an output filename.

	* plaintext.c (ask_for_detached_datafile): Enable readline
	completion when prompting for a detached sig datafile.

2005-03-21  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* keyedit.c (command_generator, keyedit_completion): Changed
	indentation.
	* card-util.c (command_generator, card_edit_completion): Ditto.

	redefine $libexecdir.

	* options.h, keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_options)
	(keyserver_spawn): Don't treat 'verbose' and 'include-disabled' as

	* ccid-driver.c (parse_ccid_descriptor): Make SCM workaround
	reader type specific.
	(scan_or_find_devices): Do not check the interface subclass in the
	SPR532 kludge, as this depends on the firmware version.
	(ccid_get_atr): Get the Slot status first.  This solves the
	problem with readers hanging on recent Linux 2.6.x.
	(bulk_in): Add argument TIMEOUT and changed all callers to pass an
	appropriate one.  Change the standard timeout from 10 to 5 seconds.
	(ccid_slot_status): Add a retry code with an initial short timeout.
	(do_close_reader): Do an usb_reset before closing the reader.

2005-03-14  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* card-util.c (card_status): Use isotimestamp and not the
	localized asctimestamp to match the timezone used in the key
	information.

	* cardglue.c (pin_cb): Disable debug output.

2005-03-11  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* keygen.c (gen_card_key_with_backup): Write status line with the
	backup filename.

	earlier.

2005-03-07  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* cardglue.c (agent_scd_pkdecrypt, agent_scd_pksign)
	(agent_scd_genkey, agent_scd_setattr, agent_scd_change_pin)
	(agent_scd_checkpin, agent_openpgp_storekey): Make sure to send a
	SC_OP_FAILURE after card operations which might change data.
	* card-util.c (change_pin): Send a SC_OP_SUCCESS after a PIN has
	been changed.
	(change_name): Removed a debug output.
	* status.h, status.c: New codes BAD_PASSPHRASE_PIN, SC_OP_FAILURE
	and SC_OP_SUCCESS.

	keyserver if no URL is available.

2005-02-15  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	if PK is NULL.
	(passphrase_clear_cache): Ditto. Removed debug output.
	(passphrase_to_dek): Ditto.

2005-02-13  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	BKUPTOCARD.

2005-02-09  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* encr-data.c (decrypt_data): Use it here to turn off the "quick
	check" bytes for PK decryptions.  This is in regards to the Mister
	and Zuccherato attack on OpenPGP CFB mode.

	* mainproc.c (proc_symkey_enc): Set a flag to indicate that a
	particular session key came from a passphrase and not a PK.

2005-02-08  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* misc.c (w32_shgetfolderpath): New.
	(default_homedir): Use it to avoid problems under Windows95.

2005-02-06  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* trustdb.h, trustdb.c (trustdb_check_or_update): New.  If the
	trustdb is dirty and --interactive is set, do an --update-trustdb.
	If not interactive, do a --check_trustdb unless
	--no-auto-check-trustdb is set.

	* import.c (import_keys_internal): Moved from here.

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_refresh): Call it here after all
	refreshing has happened so that we don't rebuild after each
	preferred keyserver set of imports, but do one big rebuild at the
	end.  This is Debian bug #293816, noted by Kurt Roeckx.

2005-02-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_subkey): Merged away definition from
	the backsigs code.

2005-01-31  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (do_generate_keypair): Write the auth key to the card
	before the encryption key.  This is a partial workaround for a PGP
	bug (as of this writing, all versions including 8.1), that causes
	it to try and encrypt to the most recent subkey regardless of
	whether that subkey is actually an encryption type.  In this case,
	the auth key is an RSA key so it succeeds.

2005-01-27  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyid.c (keyid_from_sk, keyid_from_pk): Use 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
	instead of 0x0000000000000000 for the invalid key ID since
	all-zeroes is reserved for the anonymous recipient.

	* keyedit.c (change_passphrase), keygen.c (generate_subkeypair):
	Fix a string ;)

2005-01-27  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* parse-packet.c (listfp): New.
	(set_packet_list_mode): Intialize it to stdout or stderr depending
	on a global option.  Made all printing in list mode use LISTFP.

	* keygen.c (generate_subkeypair): Detect primary key on-card and
	ask for the passphrase.  Return an error if the primary key is a
	plain stub.

	* keyedit.c (change_passphrase): Don't ever change any stub key.
	Print a note if a key consists of only stub keys.  Reported by
	Dany Nativel.  These are bugs #401 and #402.

2005-01-26  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* ccid-driver.c (parse_ccid_descriptor): Need the CSM workaround
	also for newer firmware versions.  Need to get a list of fixed
	firmware versions and use that.

2005-01-26  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_uri): Allow RFC-2732 IPv6 [literal
	address] syntax in keyserver URLs.

2005-01-25  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* keygen.c (do_generate_keypair): Don't continue after an error;
	fixed at two places. Why at all didn't I used a goto to cleanup,
	tsss?

	* app-openpgp.c (get_cached_data): New arg GET_IMMEDIATE to bypass
	the cache.  Changed all callers.
	(get_one_do): Bypass the cache if the value would have been read
	directly for v1.1 cards.  It makes things a bit slower but only for
	1.0 cards and there are not that many cards out in the wild.  This
	is required to fix a caching bug when generating new keys; as a
	side effect of the retrieval of the the C4 DO from the 6E DO the
	chaced fingerprint will get updated to the old value and later
	when signing the generated key the checking of the fingerprint
	fails becuase it won't match the new one.  Thanks to Moritz for
	analyzing this problem.
	(verify_chv3): Removed the CHV status reread logic because we
	won't cache the C4 DO anymore.

2005-01-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (free_keyserver_spec): Fix small leak.
	(keyserver_typemap): Map https if we are supporting it.

	* keylist.c (print_card_key_info): New.

	* g10.c (i18n_init) [W32]: Pass registry key to gettext

	* gpgv.c (main): Ditto.

	* keylist.c (public_key_list): Do a trustdb staleness check before

	function to get ready for the readline completion code.

	* passphrase.c (readline, agent_send_option, agent_open,
	agent_get_passphrase, passphrase_clear_cache): Rename readline()
	to readaline() to keep readline library namespace clear.

2005-01-06  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* filter.h, armor.c (armor_filter): Use the eol string from the
	armor filter context instead of hardcoding '\n' or '\r\n'.  If no
	eol string is provided, default to '\n' or '\r\n' as appropriate.
	(is_armor_header): Trim tabs in armor header lines as well.

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Use it here to force '\n' line
	endings since the keyserver output file gets a LF->CRLF expansion
	on win32.

2005-01-05  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (main): Typo.

	* armor.c (is_armor_header): Allow CR and LF (not just actual
	spaces) in an armor header line (-----BEGIN etc).  This is needed
	due to CRLF issues on win32.  As before, --openpgp makes it
	strict.

2005-01-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am: Use @LIBUSB@ instead of @LIBUSB_LIBS@

	* import.c (delete_inv_parts): Comments on import-unusable-sigs.

	keyid.c (revokestr_from_pk), keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names):
	Show who revoked a key (either the same key or a designated
	revoker) and when.

2004-12-28  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* ccid-driver.c (find_endpoint): New.

	auth data from URLs and pass to keyserver helpers.

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_typemap): New.  Map certain keyserver
	types to a common type (e.g. ldaps -> ldap).  If we are building
	with curl, map both http and ftp to curl.

	* build-packet.c (build_sig_subpkt): Only allow one preferred
	keyserver subpacket at a time.

2004-12-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (menu_set_keyserver_url): Make sure we only operate on
	the chosen selfsig so we don't accidentally promote an older
	selfsig to chosen.  Discovered by Simon Josefsson and 'Todd'.

	* keygen.c (ask_expire_interval): Fix typo.

2004-12-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keylist.c (list_keyblock_print): Secret key listings should
	always show everything (expired UIDs, revoked subkeys, etc, etc).

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu): Add additional help for the "sign"
	flags.

2004-12-20  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* keygen.c (ask_expire_interval): For better translations chnage 2
	strings.

	* seckey-cert.c (do_check): Handle case when checksum was okay but
	passphrase still wrong.  Roman Pavlik found such a case.

2004-12-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu): Invisible alias "passwd" as
	"password".

	* passphrase.c: Don't check for __CYGWIN__, so it is treated as a
	unix-like system.

	* options.h, g10.c (main), textfilter.c (standard): Use new option
	--rfc2440-text to determine whether to filter "<space>\t\r\n" or

	"<space>\t\r\n".

2004-12-19  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (keygen_get_std_prefs): Set reference count when
	creating the temporary user ID.

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu): Merge updpref and setpref.  Keep
	updpref as an invisible alias.  Add invisible alias for revphoto.

	freed).
	(menu_revkey): Trigger a trust rebuild after revoking a key.
	Don't allow revoking an already-revoked whole key.
	(menu_revsubkey): Don't allow revoking an already-revoked subkey.

	(menu_revkey): New.  Revoke a whole key.
	(keyedit_menu): Call it here for when 'revkey' is used without any

	functions which are "selected part if selected, whole key if not".

	* signal.c: Use only HAVE_LIBREADLINE to detect readline
	availability.

	* Makefile.am: Link with readline where necessary.

	gpg to exit if it cannot lock memory.  Also remove --nrsign-key
	and --nrlsign-key since this can better be done via --edit-key.

	* apdu.c (apdu_send_le, apdu_send_direct), keylist.c
	(status_one_subpacket, print_one_subpacket): Fix some compiler
	warnings.

	* g10.c (main): Fix --compression-algo to take a string argument
	like --compress-algo.

	* trustdb.c (uid_trust_string_fixed): For safety, check for a pk.

2004-12-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	or --openpgp directly to determine the end of line hashing rule.

	* trustdb.c (uid_trust_string_fixed): Show uids as expired if the
	key is expired.

2004-12-10  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* card-util.c (card_status): Print creation time if available.

2004-12-09  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main), textfilter.c (len_without_trailing_ws):
	Removed (not used).
	(standard): 2440 says that textmode hashes should canonicalize
	line endings to CRLF and remove spaces and tabs.  2440bis-12 says
	to just canonicalize to CRLF.  So, we default to the 2440bis-12
	behavior, but revert to the strict 2440 behavior if the user
	specifies --rfc2440.  In practical terms this makes no difference
	to any signatures in the real world except for a textmode detached
	signature.

2004-12-09  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* passphrase.c (agent_get_passphrase): New args CUSTOM_PROMPT and

	atoi-ed, but also has a comment for the translator.

	* trustdb.h, trustdb.c (uid_trust_string_fixed): New.  Return a
	fixed-size translatable string similar to trust_value_to_string.
	This allows for easier lining up of displays.

	arguments to the PIN callback.  Use this to implement a way to
	check for correct PIN repetition.  Changed all callers to pass an
	opaque argument. Improved detection of Admin PIN prompts.

2004-11-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* plaintext.c (handle_plaintext): Don't try and create a
	zero-length filename when using --use-embedded-filename with input

	pipe).

	* encode.c (encode_simple, encode_crypt), progress.c
	(handle_progress), sign.c (write_plaintext_packet): Fix a few

	* sign.c (update_keysig_packet): Revert change of 2004-05-18.  It

	show-uid-validity as it only shows for uids.

	* armor.c (armor_filter): Do not use padding to get us to 8 bytes

	a fake filename of "is".

2004-07-15  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids): Properly handle remaking a self-sig on
	revoked or expired user IDs.  Also, once we've established that a

	about each sig.

	* mainproc.c (proc_symkey_enc), seckey-cert.c (do_check): Check
	the S2K hash algorithm before we try to generate a passphrase
	using it.  This prevents hitting BUG() when generating a

	* sign.c (sign_symencrypt_file): Allow using --force-mdc in --sign
	--symmetric messages.

	* g10.c (main): Alias --charset as --display-charset to help avoid

	literal packet mode since it may not be printable.

	* keygen.c (make_backsig): Make sure that the backsig was built
	successfully before we try and use it.

	(handle_plaintext): New status tags PLAINTEXT and
	PLAINTEXT_LENGTH.

	code.

2004-05-26  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_refresh): Keep track of keys already
	fetched so we don't do a regular keyserver fetch if the preferred
	keyserver fetch has exhausted the list.

2004-05-23  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* verify.c (verify_signatures): Verify multiple files in the same
	order in which we hashed them when issuing the signature.  Noted

	keyservers, and auto-key-retrieve is set, try and get a missing
	key from the preferred keyserver subpacket when we verify the sig.

	* gpgv.c (parse_preferred_keyserver, free_keyserver_spec): Stubs.

	* keyserver.c (keyidlist): Use new parse_preferred_keyserver
	function.

	New function to take a sig and return a split out keyserver_spec.
	(keyserver_import_keyid): Now takes a keyserver_spec.

	* keyserver.c (keyidlist): Go back to the old fast keyid lister.
	Only merge selfsigs if we have to for honor-keyserver-url.

	this also fixes an old problem when the first key on the secret
	keyring has an unusable stub primary, but is still chosen.

	* getkey.c (key_byname): If namelist is NULL, return the first key
	in the keyring.

2004-04-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (make_backsig): If DO_BACKSIGS is not defined, do not
	create backsigs.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_subkey): Find 0x19 backsigs on subkey
	selfsigs and verify they are valid.  If DO_BACKSIGS is not
	defined, fake this as always valid.

	* packet.h, parse-packet.c (parse_signature): Make parse_signature
	non-static so we can parse 0x19s in self-sigs.

	* main.h, sig-check.c (check_backsig): Check a 0x19 signature.
	(signature_check2): Give a backsig warning if there is no or a bad
	0x19 with signatures from a subkey.

2004-04-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* parse-packet.c (dump_sig_subpkt, parse_one_sig_subpkt,
	can_handle_critical): Parse and display 0x19 signatures.

2004-04-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_uri): Do not accept "http" as an
	alias for "hkp".  They are not the same thing.

2004-04-19  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main): Add keyserver-option
	honor-keyserver-url.  parse_keyserver_options now returns a
	success code.

	* keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_options): Return error on failure
	to parse.  Currently there is no way to fail as any unrecognized
	options get saved to be sent to the keyserver plugins later.
	Check length of keyserver option tokens since with =arguments we
	must only match the prefix.
	(free_keyserver_spec): Moved code from parse_keyserver_url.
	(keyserver_work, keyserver_spawn): Pass in a struct keyserver_spec
	rather than using the global keyserver option.
	(calculate_keyid_fpr): New.  Fills in a KEYDB_SEARCH_DESC for a
	key.
	(keyidlist): New implementation using get_pubkey_bynames rather
	than searching the keydb directly.  If honor-keyserver-url is set,
	make up a keyserver_spec and try and fetch that key directly.  Do
	not include it in the returned keyidlist in that case.

2004-04-16  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* plaintext.c (handle_plaintext): Accept 'u' as a plaintext mode
	that requires end of line conversion.  This is being considered
	for a UTF8 text packet.  If this doesn't take place, no major harm
	done.  If it does take place, we'll get a jump on starting the
	changeover.

	* g10.c (main): --no-use-embedded-filename.

	* build-packet.c (calc_plaintext, do_plaintext): Do not create
	illegal (packet header indicates a size larger than the actual
	packet) encrypted data packets when not compressing and using a
	filename longer than 255 characters.

	* keyedit.c (no_primary_warning): Cleanup. (menu_expire): Don't
	give primary warning for subkey expiration changes.  These cannot
	reorder primaries.

	* keygen.c (gen_elg, gen_dsa, gen_rsa, do_create,
	do_generate_keypair, generate_subkeypair): New is_subkey argument
	to set whether a generated key is a subkey.  Do not overload the
	ret_sk.  This is some early cleanup to do backsigs for signing
	subkeys.

	* keygen.c (write_keybinding, do_generate_keypair,
	generate_subkeypair): Keep track of the unprotected subkey secret
	key so we can make a backsig with it.

	* keygen.c (make_backsig): New function to add a backsig to a
	binding sig of signing subkeys.  Currently disabled.
	(write_keybinding): Call it here, for signing subkeys only.

	* sign.c (make_keysig_packet): Allow generating 0x19 signatures
	(same as 0x18 or 0x28, but used for backsigs).

	* packet.h, build-packet.c (build_sig_subpkt): Add new
	SIGSUBPKT_SIGNATURE type for embedded signatures.

	* main.h, misc.c (optsep, argsplit, optlen, parse_options):
	Simplify code and properly handle a partial match against an
	option with an argument.

	* keyserver-internal.h, keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_options): Use
	new optsep and argsplit functions.

2004-04-15  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* main.h, misc.c (argsplit): Refactor argsep into argsplit and
	argsep so they can be called separately.

	* options.h, keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_options): Remove
	duplicate code from parse_keyserver_options by calling the generic
	parse_options.

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn, keyserver_refresh), g10.c (main),
	gpgv.c (main), mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print), import.c
	(revocation_present): Change all callers.

2004-04-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* packet.h, getkey.c (fixup_uidnode, merge_selfsigs_subkey): Keep
	track of which self-sig we actually chose.

	* keyedit.c (menu_expire, menu_set_primary_uid,
	menu_set_preferences): Use it here to avoid updating non-used
	self-sigs and possibly promoting an old self-sig into
	consideration again.

	* options.h, import.c, keyserver-internal.h, g10.c, mainproc.c,
	keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_uri): Parse keyserver URI into a
	structure.  Cleanup for new "guess my keyserver" functionality, as
	well as refreshing via a preferred keyserver subpacket.

	* options.h: Encapsulate keyserver details.  Change all callers.

2004-04-05  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* status.h (STATUS_NEWSIG): New.
	* status.c (get_status_string): Add it.

2004-03-27  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu): Request a trustdb update when adding a
	new user ID so the new ID gets validity set.  Reported by Owen
	Taylor.

2004-03-25  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main), compress-bz2.c (init_uncompress):
	Rename --bzip2-compress-lowmem to --bzip2-decompress-lowmem since
	it applies to decompression, not compression.

2004-03-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids, show_key_and_fingerprint, ask_revoke_sig,
	menu_revsig, menu_showphoto): --keyid-format conversion.
	(menu_addrevoker): Use print_pubkey_info() rather than duplicating
	code.

2004-03-19  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* trustdb.c (update_min_ownertrust, validate_keys): Do not use
	keystr functions in log_debug.

	* import.c (import_one): Try and collapse user IDs when importing
	a key for the first time.

	* keyedit.c (menu_addrevoker): Allow appointing a subkey as a
	designated revoker if the user forces it via keyid!, so long as
	the subkey can certify.  Also use the proper date string when
	prompting for confirmation.

	* g10.c (main): Maintain ordering of multiple Comment lines.
	Requested by Peter Hyman.

2004-03-17  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* mainproc.c (proc_pubkey_enc, print_pkenc_list, list_node):
	--keyid-format conversion.

2004-03-16  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* getkey.c (skip_unusable, merge_selfsigs_main,
	premerge_public_with_secret, lookup, get_user_id_string):
	--keyid-format conversion.

2004-03-15  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* trustdb.c (add_utk, verify_own_keys, update_min_ownertrust,
	get_validity, ask_ownertrust, validate_keys): --keyid-format
	conversion.

	* import.c (check_prefs_warning, check_prefs): --keyid-format
	conversion and a little better text.
	(import_one, import_secret_one, import_revoke_cert, chk_self_sigs,
	delete_inv_parts, merge_blocks): Still more --keyid-format
	conversions.

2004-03-06  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keylist.c (print_seckey_info, print_pubkey_info): --keyid-format
	conversion.
	(list_keyblock_print): 0xshort should not push us into the new
	list format since it is not much longer than regular 8-character
	short keyids.

	* keydb.h, keyid.c (keystr_from_pk, keystr_from_sk): New functions
	to pull a key string from a key in one step.  This isn't faster
	than before, but makes for neater code.

	* keylist.c (list_keyblock_print): Use keystr_from_xx here.
	(print_key_data): No need to pass a keyid in.

2004-03-05  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyid.c (keyid_from_sk): Minor performance boost by caching
	secret key keyids so we don't have to calculate them each time.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_subkey): Do not mark subkeys valid if
	we do not support their pk algorithm.  This allows for early
	(during get_*) rejection of a subkey, and selection of another.

	* passphrase.c (passphrase_to_dek): Give a little more information
	when we have room to do so.

2004-03-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* revoke.c (export_minimal_pk), export.c (do_export_stream),
	passphrase.c (passphrase_to_dek), keyserver.c (print_keyrec): A
	few more places to use --keyid-format.

	* options.h, g10.c (main), export.c (parse_export_options,
	do_export_stream): Remove --export-all and the "include-non-rfc"
	export-option as they are no longer meaningful with the removal of
	v3 Elgamal keys.

	* armor.c (fake_packet, armor_filter): Use the 2440 partial length
	encoding for the faked plaintext packet.

2004-03-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main), mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print):
	Remove verify-option show-long-keyids and replace with
	the more general keyid-format.

	* build-packet.c (write_header2): Remove call to start old gpg
	partial length mode and change all callers.
	(do_plaintext): Turn off partial length encoding now that we're
	done writing the packet.
	(do_comment, do_user_id): Try for a headerlen of 2 since that's
	the smallest and most likely encoding for these packets.

	* parse-packet.c (parse): Remove call to start old gpg partial
	length mode.

2004-03-02  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main): Add a more flexible --keyid-format
	option to replace the list-option (and eventually verify-option)
	show-long-keyids.  The format can be short, long, 0xshort, and
	0xlong.

	* keydb.h, keyid.c (keystr, keystrlen): New functions to generate
	a printable keyid.

	* keyedit.c (print_and_check_one_sig, show_key_with_all_names),
	keylist.c (list_keyblock_print): Use new keystr() function here to
	print keyids.

	* packet.h, free-packet.c (free_encrypted, free_plaintext),
	parse-packet.c (copy_packet, skip_packet, skip_rest, read_rest,
	parse_plaintext, parse_encrypted, parse_gpg_control): Use a flag
	to indicate partial or indeterminate encoding.  This is the first
	step in some minor surgery to remove the old gpg partial length
	encoding.

2004-03-01  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* parse-packet.c (parse): Only data-type packets are allowed to
	use OpenPGP partial length encoding.

2004-02-25  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* delkey.c (do_delete_key): Allow deleting a public key with a
	secret present if --expert is set.

	* plaintext.c (handle_plaintext): Make bytecount static so it
	works with multiple literal packets inside a message.

	* encode.c, helptext.c (keygen.algo, keygen.algo.elg_se), keygen.c
	(ask_algo), sig-check.c (do_check_messages), skclist.c
	(build_sk_list): Rename "ElGamal" to "Elgamal" as that is the
	proper spelling nowadays.  Suggested by Jon Callas.

2004-02-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* plaintext.c: Copyright.

	* encode.c (encode_simple): Show cipher with --verbose.

	* options.h, g10.c (main), keyedit.c (sign_keys): Add
	--ask-cert-level option to enable cert level prompts during
	sigs. Defaults to on.  Simplify --default-cert-check-level to
	--default-cert-level.  If ask-cert-level is off, or batch is on,
	use the default-cert-level as the cert level.

	* options.h, g10.c (main), trustdb.c (mark_usable_uid_certs):
	Simplify --min-cert-check-level to --min-cert-level.

2004-02-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main), trustdb.c (mark_usable_uid_certs): Add
	--min-cert-check-level option to specify minimum cert check level.
	Defaults to 2 (so 0x11 sigs are ignored).  0x10 sigs cannot be
	ignored.

2004-02-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* plaintext.c (handle_plaintext): Properly handle a --max-output
	of zero (do not limit output at all).

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Use the full 64-bit keyid in the
	INFO header lines, and include "sig:" records for the benefit of
	people who store their keys in LDAP servers.  It makes it easy to
	do queries for things like "all keys signed by Isabella".

	* main.h, misc.c (hextobyte): Removed.  It's in libutil.a now.

2004-02-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_export): Disallow user strings that
	aren't key IDs.
	(keyserver_import): Clarify error message.
	(keyserver_spawn): Properly handle 8 bit characters in user IDs in
	the info lines during SEND.

	* mkdtemp.c: Removed.

	* Makefile.am: We get mkdtemp.c from libutil.a now, so don't link
	with @LIBOBJS@.

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Pass the scheme to the keyserver
	helper.

2004-02-18  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main), plaintext.c (handle_plaintext): Add
	--max-output option to help people deal with decompression bombs.

2004-02-15  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* build-packet.c (do_user_id): Do not force a header for attribute
	packets as they require a new CTB, and we don't support forced
	headers for new CTBs yet.

2004-02-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* build-packet.c (write_header2): If a suggested header length is
	provided along with a zero length, interpret this as an actual
	zero length packet and not as an indeterminate length packet.
	(do_comment, do_user_id): Use it here as these packets might be
	naturally zero length.

	* parse-packet.c (parse): Show packet type when failing due to an
	indeterminate length packet.

	* misc.c (parse_options): Only provide args for the true (i.e. not
	"no-xxx") form of options.

2004-02-13  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (argsep): Move to misc.c.

	* main.h, misc.c (parse_options), export.c (parse_export_options),
	import.c (parse_import_options), g10.c (main): Use it here to
	allow for options with optional arguments.  Change all callers.

	* import.c (check_prefs): Some language fixes.
	(sec_to_pub_keyblock, import_secret_one): Without knowing the
	number of MPIs there are, we cannot try and sk-to-pk-ize a key.

2004-02-12  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* import.c (check_prefs): New function to check preferences on a
	public key to ensure that it does not advertise any that we cannot
	fulfill.  Use the keyedit command list function to optionally
	rewrite the prefs.
	(import_one, import_secret_one): Use it here when importing a
	public key that we have the secret half of, or when importing a
	secret key that we have the public half of.

	* main.h, keyedit.c (keyedit_menu): Remove sign_mode and enhance
	the more general command list functionality to replace it.

	* g10.c (main): Use the general command functionality to implement
	--sign-key, --lsign-key, --nrsign-key, and --nrlsign-key.

	* import.c (import_one): Do the revocation check even in the case
	when a key, a revocation key set in a direct key signature, and a
	revocation from that revocation key, all arrive piecemeal.
	Needless to say, this is pretty obscure.

2004-02-11  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main), keylist.c (list_keyblock_print): Add
	"show-unusable-subkeys" list-option to show revoked and/or expired
	subkeys.

2004-02-10  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu): Prompt for subkey removal for both
	secret and public subkeys.

	* keylist.c (list_keyblock_print), keyedit.c
	(show_key_with_all_names): Show the revocation date of a
	key/subkey, and general formatting work.

	* packet.h, getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main, merge_selfsigs_subkey,
	merge_selfsigs): Keep track of the revocation date of a key.

	* keydb.h, keyid.c (revokestr_from_pk): New function to print the
	revocation date of a key.

	* keygen.c (keygen_set_std_prefs): Build the default preferences
	list at runtime as it properly handles algorithms disabled at
	build or run time.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main): Properly handle expired user IDs
	when the expired self-sig is not the only self-sig.

	* misc.c (compress_algo_to_string): Return NULL on failure like
	all of the other xxxx_algo_to_string() functions.

	* mainproc.c (list_node): Minor spacing tweak to match --list-keys
	output.

	* keylist.c (list_keyblock_print), mainproc.c (list_node): Mark
	revoked subkeys as revoked.  Requested by Matthew Wilcox.  Revoked
	overrides expiration when both apply.

	* keyedit.c (show_prefs): Use compress algo constants.
	(show_basic_key_info): Make revoked and expired tags translatable.

	* g10.c (rm_group): Properly ungroup from a list of groups.

2004-01-30  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (main, rm_group): Add --ungroup command to remove a
	particular group.
	(add_group): When adding a group with the same name as an already
	existing group, merge the two groups.
	(list_config): Show an error message when listing a config item
	that doesn't exist.
	(main): Replace -z0 trick for no compression.

	* packet.h, keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names_colon), keylist.c
	(list_keyblock_colon), mainproc.c (list_node, proc_tree): Minor
	cleanup to remove local_id, which is no longer used.

2004-01-27  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* getkey.c: Set MAX_PK_CACHE_ENTRIES and MAX_UID_CACHE_ENTRIES to
	PK_UID_CACHE_SIZE (set in ./configure).

	* getkey.c (get_pubkey): When reading key data into the cache,
	properly handle keys that are partially (pk, no UIDs) cached
	already.  This is Debian bug #176425 and #229549.

	* compress.c (init_compress, push_compress_filter2): Do the right
	thing (i.e. nothing) with compress algo 0.

	* main.h, decrypt.c (decrypt_messages): Accept filenames to
	decrypt on stdin.  This is bug #253.

2004-01-23  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* mainproc.c (list_node): Show sigs with --verbose.

	* options.h, g10.c (set_screen_dimensions): New function to look
	at COLUMNS and LINES.

	(print_and_check_one_sig): Use new screen dimension variables.

2004-01-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (list_config): New function to dump config options to
	stdout.  Currently requires --with-colons.
	(collapse_args): New function to turn argc/argv into a single
	string.
	(main): Use it here to pass list_config() more than one argument
	as a single string.
	(print_algo_numbers): Helper to print algorithm number for
	--list-config "pubkey", "cipher", "hash"/"digest", and "compress"
	config options.

	* packet.h, getkey.c (merge_selfsigs, merge_selfsigs_main),
	pkclist.c (check_signatures_trust): Indicate who has revoked a key
	(the owner or a designated revoker).  If a key was revoked by
	both, prefer the owner.  If a subkey is already revoked by the
	owner, don't allow a designated revokation of the whole key to
	override this.  We're still revoked either way, of course.

	* keyedit.c (print_and_check_one_sig, keyedit_menu): Use the
	COLUMNS environment variable (if any) to hint how wide the
	terminal is.  Disabled on _WIN32.  Suggested by Janusz
	A. Urbanowicz.

2004-01-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keylist.c (set_attrib_fd): Open attribute fd in binary
	mode. This isn't meaningful on POSIX systems, but the Mingw builds
	aren't exactly POSIX.

	* trustdb.c (reset_trust_records): New, faster, implementation
	that doesn't involve a keyring scan.
	(clear_validity): Removed.

	* g10.c (main), keydb.h, keydb.c (keydb_rebuild_caches),
	keyring.h, keyring.c (keyring_rebuild_cache): Add "noisy" flag so
	cache rebuilds can remain noisy when called for itself, and quiet
	when called as part of the trustdb rebuild.

	* trustdb.c (validate_keys): Rebuild the sig caches before
	building the trustdb.  Note that this is going to require some
	architectual re-thinking, as it is agonizingly slow.

2004-01-19  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* sig-check.c (check_key_signature2): Comments.

	* keyring.c (keyring_rebuild_cache): Clear sig cache for any
	signatures that we can no longer process (say, if the user removed
	support for a necessary pubkey or digest algorithm).

2004-01-16  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* misc.c (print_cipher_algo_note): May as well call Rijndael AES
	at this point.

	* keygen.c (do_create), misc.c (openpgp_pk_algo_usage): Remove the
	last bits of Elgamal type 20 support.

2004-01-03  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* compress.c [__riscos__]: Only use RISC OS' own ZLib module if
	configured to use it.

2003-12-30  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main), import.c (parse_import_options,
	import_one, import_secret_one), keyserver.c (keyserver_refresh):
	Change --merge-only to --import-option merge-only.  Deprecate
	--merge-only.

2003-12-29  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* misc.c (pull_in_libs): Dead code.  Removed.

	* sig-check.c (check_revocation_keys): Comments.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main): Don't bother to check designated
	revoker sigs if the key is already revoked.

	* packet.h, getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main): New "maybe_revoked"
	flag on PKs.  It is set when there is a revocation signature from
	a valid revocation key, but the revocation key is not present to
	verify the signature.

	* pkclist.c (check_signatures_trust): Use it here to give a
	warning when showing key trust.

	* compress-bz2.c: Include stdio.h.  Solaris 9 has a very old bzip2
	library and we can at least guarantee that it won't fail because
	of the lack of stdio.h.

	* tdbio.c: Fixed format string bugs related to the use of DB_NAME.
	Reported by Florian Weimer.

2003-12-28  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main), keyserver.c (keyserver_opts,
	parse_keyserver_uri): honor-http-proxy is no longer an option
	since we can do the same thing with http-proxy with no arguments.
	Also remove broken-http-proxy since it can be better handled in
	the HTTP helper.

	* keyserver.c (argsep): New variation on strsep that knows about
	optional arguments.
	(parse_keyserver_options): Use it here for optional arguments.

2003-12-28  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* plaintext.c (handle_plaintext) [__riscos__]: Don't mangle
	filename if the user specified it.

	* g10.c, gpgv.c [__riscos__]: Removal of unnecessary #ifdef
	__riscos__ sections.

2003-12-27  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (strip_leading_space, get_arg): New.
	(parse_keyserver_options): Use them here to allow arguments to
	keyserver-options.  Since none of our options need arguments yet,
	just pass them through whole to the keyserver helper.

	* main.h, misc.c (parse_options): Add a "noisy" flag to enable and
	disable the messages about which option didn't match or matched
	ambiguously.  Change all callers (g10.c, keyserver.c).

	* main.h, import.c (import_options), export.c (export_options):
	Pass the noisy flag through.

2003-12-17  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* build-packet.c (write_fake_data, do_secret_key), seckey-cert.c
	(do_check): Use an unsigned length for mpi_get_opaque.

	* options.h: It's impolite to assign -1 to an unsigned
	opt.force_ownertrust.

	* sig-check.c (cmp_help, do_check), sign.c (do_sign): Remove old
	unused code.

	* keyid.c (keyid_from_sk): Make sure lowbits is initialized.

2003-12-12  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* sig-check.c (do_check): Move the signing algo and hash checks
	from here...
	(signature_check2): ... to here.
	(check_key_signature2): ... and here.  This is a minor
	optimization to avoid fetching a key (which can be expensive,
	especially if it is not self-signed, and there are many key
	signatures on it which need to be checked for ultimate trust) if
	the signature would have failed anyway because of algorithm or
	hash problems.

2003-12-10  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* packet.h, build-packet.c (hash_public_key): Remove function ...

	* keydb.h, keyid.c (hash_public_key, do_fingerprint_md): ... and
	make a new one here that shares code with the fingerprint
	calculations.  This removes some duplicated functionality, and is
	also around 14% faster.  (Every bit helps).

	* import.c (import_one): No longer need the Elgamal import
	warning.

	* getkey.c (get_pubkey_fast): This one is sort of obscure.
	get_pubkey_fast returns the primary key when requesting a subkey,
	so if a user has a key signed by a subkey (we don't do this, but
	used to), AND that key is not self-signed, AND the algorithm of
	the subkey in question is not present in GnuPG, AND the algorithm
	of the primary key that owns the subkey in question is present in
	GnuPG, then we will try and verify the subkey signature using the
	primary key algorithm and hit a BUG().  The fix is to not return a
	hit if the keyid is not the primary.  All other users of
	get_pubkey_fast already expect a primary only.

2003-12-09  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyid.c (do_fingerprint_md): Remove the rules to hash the old v3
	Elgamal keys.  They are no longer needed.

	* keyid.c (keyid_from_sk, keyid_from_pk, fingerprint_from_pk,
	fingerprint_from_sk): Enforce the v3-is-only-RSA rule.  Anything
	that isn't RSA gets a zero keyid and fingerprint.

	* keyid.c (do_fingerprint_md): Properly handle hashing of keys
	that we don't know the structure of by using the opaque MPI.
	(do_fingerprint_md_sk): We cannot calculate the fingerprint from a
	secret key unless we know the structure (since we can't leave off
	the secret key parts), so fail early.....
	(keyid_from_sk, fingerprint_from_sk): .... and return all zeroes.

2003-12-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (strusage, main): Show development version warning in
	--version output.
	(main): Set --bzip2-compress-level to the default value at
	startup.  Remove --emulate-checksum-bug noop.

	* options.h, g10.c (main), main.h, seskey.c (do_encode_md,
	encode_md_value), sig-check.c (do_check), sign.c (do_sign): Remove
	--emulate-md-encode-bug as it only applied to Elgamal signatures,
	which are going away.

2003-11-30  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* mainproc.c (proc_symkey_enc, proc_encrypted): Add ability to use
	--override-session-key on --symmetric messages (new-style or
	old-style).
	(proc_pubkey_enc): Move code to show session key from here to
	proc_encrypted() so it can work with any type of message.
	Suggested by Michael Young.

2003-11-29  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* trustdb.c (validate_keys): Reset the trustdb before checking if
	we have any ultimately trusted keys.  This ensures that if we lose
	all our ultimately trusted keys, we don't leave behind the old
	validity calculations.  Noted by Peter Palfrader.

	* revoke.c (gen_desig_revoke): Specify in the comment when a
	designated revocation is generated.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main, merge_selfsigs_subkey,
	get_seckey_byname2): Remove Elgamal check since we are removing
	type 20 keys altogether.

2003-11-27  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* pkclist.c (build_pk_list): Do not allow an empty PK list in
	interactive mode.

	* keygen.c (ask_algo): Remove ability to generate Elgamal
	sign+encrypt keys.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main, merge_selfsigs_subkey,
	get_seckey_byname2): Disallow use of sign+encrypt Elgamal keys.

2003-11-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* seskey.c (do_encode_md): Comment about earlier (pre-PGP 2.3)
	encodings.

	* misc.c (compress_algo_to_string): Translate "Uncompressed".
	Requested by Tommi Vainikainen.
	(string_to_compress_algo): Include multi-string for
	"uncompressed|none".

2003-11-17  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main), compress-bz2.c (init_uncompress): Add
	--bz2-compress-lowmem to set bzlib "small" flag for low memory
	(but slow) decompression.

2003-11-15  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* compress.c (init_compress): Remove compress level 10 trick,
	since it is no longer needed.

	* g10.c: Fix typoed option name.

	* compress-bz2.c (init_compress): Compression level 0 is not
	meaningful for bzip2.

	* options.h, g10.c (main), compress.c (init_compress),
	compress-bz2.c (init_compress): Add --compress-level and
	--bzip2-compress-level.  -z sets them both.  Change various
	callers.

	* encode.c (encode_simple), sign.c (sign_symencrypt_file):
	Properly use default_compress_algo (--compress-algo, followed by
	the highest --personal-compress-preference, followed by ZIP) to
	get the algorithm.

2003-11-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, trustdb.c (trust_model_string, init_trustdb): Add
	support for "external" trust model, where the user can provide a

	an external trust model trustdb.

2003-11-13  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c, keyedit.c, keylist.c, mainproc.c: Clarify the
	plurarility (or not) of various list and verify options.

	message that can be decrypted with a passphrase or a pk.

	* sign.c (sign_file): Call setup_symkey if we are doing a
	--symmetric --sign --encrypt.

2003-11-09  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* mainproc.c (proc_symkey_enc): Don't show algorithm information
	when --quiet is set.  Suggested by Duncan Harris.  Also don't fail
	with BUG() when processing a --symmetric message with a cipher we
	don't have.

	* g10.c: Alias --personal-xxx-prefs to --personal-xxx-preferences.

	* pkclist.c (build_pk_list): When adding recipients interactively,
	allow the user to stop at any point.

	* trustdb.h, trustdb.c (register_trusted_keyid): New.  Adds a
	keyid to the list of ultimately trusted keys.

	* keygen.c (do_generate_keypair): Use it here so that the ultimate
	ownertrust happens before the trustdb (might be) rebuilt.  Also
	fix an error where the newly generated pk is thought to be a
	subkey by the trustdb.

	* g10.c (main): Fix --export-all do actually do something
	different than --export.

	* pkclist.c (build_pk_list): Show all recipients rather than
	showing each recipient as they are added.

	* mainproc.c (proc_symkey_enc, proc_encrypted): Keep a count of
	the number of passphrases that can decrypt a symmetric or mixed
	symmetric/pk message and include it in the list of keys shown to
	the user.

	* misc.c (compress_algo_to_string, string_to_compress_algo,
	check_compress_algo): Add bzip2.

	* filter.h, compress.c (push_compress_filter,
	push_compress_filter2): New.  Figure out which is the appropriate
	compression filter to use, and push it into place.

2003-10-28  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* keylist.c (list_keyblock_print): Denote secrets keys stored on a
	card with an '>'. Print the '#' also for subkeys.

	try for more specific matches before giving up (e.g. 1.3.3-cvs,
	1.3.3, 1.3, 1).

2003-10-25  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	(encode_simple): Use the actual symmetric cipher when encrypting a
	session key for a symmetric message.

	difference here between a bad passphrase and a cipher algorithm
	that we don't have, so use a error message that makes that clear.
	Use the actual list of ciphers when checking whether a cipher is
	invalid.  Return error if the decrypted cipher algorithm is
	invalid.
	(proc_symkey_enc): In a mixed passphrase/pk message, if a valid
	dek already exists from decrypting via pk, do not try to process
	the passphrase.
	(proc_symkey_enc): Indicate when we're decrypting a session key as
	opposed to decrypting data.  If a passphrase is invalid, discard
	the dek so we'll keep trying.

	directly to check for MDC usability.  Do not set the force_mdc or
	disable_mdc flags since there is no point any longer.

2003-09-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* armor.c (parse_hash_header, armor_filter), g10.c (print_hex,
	print_mds), pkclist.c (algo_available): Drop TIGER/192 support.

2003-09-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names): Fix assertion failure when
	using toggle to see a secret key.  Reported by Maxim Britov.

2003-08-31  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (add_keyserver_url), keyedit.c (keyedit_menu), sign.c
	(mk_notation_policy_etc): Clarify a few strings.  It's a
	"preferred keyserver URL".

	* g10.c (main): Use "keyserver-url" instead of
	"preferred-keyserver" for the sake of short and simple commands.

2003-08-30  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* main.h, keygen.c (keygen_add_keyserver_url): Signature callback
	for adding a keyserver URL.

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu, menu_set_keyserver_url): New command to
	set preferred keyserver to specified (or all) user IDs.

	* build-packet.c (build_sig_subpkt): Set preferred keyserver flag
	while building a preferred keyserver subpacket.

	* keylist.c (show_policy_url, show_keyserver_url): URLs might be
	UTF8.

	* keyedit.c (menu_addrevoker): Fix leaking a few bytes.

2003-08-29  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names): Use list-option
	show-long-keyid in main --edit-key display.

	* keyedit.c (print_and_check_one_sig): Use list-option
	show-long-keyid in --edit-key "check" function.

2003-08-28  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* passphrase.c (agent_send_all_options): Make use of $GPG_TTY.

	* g10.c (main): Disable use-agent if passphrase-fd is given
	later. Suggested by Kurt Garloff.

	* exec.c, g10.c, gpgv.c, passphrase.c, photoid.c:
	s/__MINGW32__/_WIN32/ to help building on native Windows
	compilers.  Requested by Brian Gladman.  From Werner on stable
	branch.

2003-08-25  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main): Add list-option
	list-preferred-keyserver.

	* keyedit.c (change_passphrase): When responding 'no' to the blank
	passphrase question, re-prompt for a new passphrase.  This is bug
	#202.

	* mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print): Use two different preferred
	keyserver displays - one if the key is not present (to tell the
	user where to get the key), the other if it is present (to tell
	the user where the key can be refreshed).

	* packet.h, parse-packet.c (parse_signature): Set flag if a
	preferred keyserver is present.

	* keylist.c (list_keyblock_print): Show keyserver url in listings
	with list-option show-keyserver-url.

2003-08-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am: Use NETLIBS instead of EGDLIBS.

	* mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print): Get the uid validity before
	printing any sig results to avoid munging the output with trustdb
	warnings.

	* g10.c (main): Don't include --show-keyring in --help as it is
	deprecated.

2003-08-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgv.c: Remove extra semicolon (typo).

	* options.skel: Note that keyserver.pgp.com isn't synchronized,
	and explain the roundrobin a bit better.

	* sig-check.c (check_key_signature2), import.c (import_one,
	import_revoke_cert, chk_self_sigs, delete_inv_parts,
	collapse_uids, merge_blocks): Make much quieter during import of
	slightly munged, but recoverable, keys. Use log_error for
	unrecoverable import failures.

	* keyring.c (keyring_rebuild_cache): Comment.

	* sign.c (mk_notation_and_policy): Making a v3 signature with
	notations or policy urls is an error, not an info (i.e. increment
	the errorcount). Don't print the notation or policy url to stdout
	since it can be mixed into the output stream when piping and munge
	the stream.

2003-08-12  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* packet.h, sig-check.c (signature_check2, do_check,
	do_check_messages): Provide a signing-key-is-revoked flag.  Change
	all callers.

	* status.h, status.c (get_status_string): New REVKEYSIG status tag
	for a good signature from a revoked key.

	* mainproc.c (do_check_sig, check_sig_and_print): Use it here.

	* import.c (import_revoke_cert, merge_blocks, merge_sigs): Compare
	actual signatures on import rather than using keyid or class
	matching.  This does not change actual behavior with a key, but
	does mean that all sigs are imported whether they will be used or
	not.

	* parse-packet.c (parse_signature): Don't give "signature packet
	without xxxx" warnings for experimental pk algorithms.  An
	experimental algorithm may not have a notion of (for example) a
	keyid (i.e. PGP's x.509 stuff).

2003-08-02  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main), keylist.c (list_keyblock_print),
	keyedit.c (print_and_check_one_sig): New "show-sig-expire"
	list-option to show signature expiration dates (if any).

2003-07-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main, add_keyserver_url): Add
	--sig-preferred-keyserver to implant a "where to get my key"
	subpacket into a signature.

	* sign.c (mk_notation_and_policy): Rename to
	mk_notation_policy_etc and add preferred keyserver support for
	signatures.

2003-07-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (do_add_key_flags): Don't set the certify flag for
	subkeys.
	(ask_algo): Provide key flags for DSA, Elgamal_e, and Elgamal
	subkeys.
	(generate_keypair): Provide key flags for the default DSA/Elgamal
	keys.

	* sig-check.c (signature_check, signature_check2,
	check_key_signature, check_key_signature2): Allow passing NULLs
	for unused parameters in the x2 form of each function to avoid the
	need for dummy variables. getkey.c, mainproc.c: Change all
	callers.

	* trustdb.h, trustdb.c (read_trust_options): New.  Returns items
	from the trustdb version record.

	* keylist.c (public_key_list): Use it here for the new "tru"
	record.

	* gpgv.c (read_trust_options): Stub.

2003-07-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names): Use list-option
	show-validity in --edit-key interface as well.

2003-07-19  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main), mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print): Add
	verify-options "show-validity" and "show-long-keyid" to show
	trustdb validity and long keyids during (file) signature
	verification.

	* packet.h, main.h, sig-check.c (signature_check2,
	check_key_signature2, do_check): If ret_pk is set, fill in the pk
	used to verify the signature.  Change all callers in getkey.c,
	mainproc.c, and sig-check.c.

	* keylist.c (list_keyblock_colon): Use the ret_pk from above to
	put the fingerprint of the signing key in "sig" records during a
	--with-colons --check-sigs.  This requires --no-sig-cache as well
	since we don't cache fingerprints.

2003-07-10  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* parse-packet.c (parse_signature): No need to reserve 8 bytes for
	the unhashed signature cache any longer.

	* misc.c (pct_expando): Add two new expandos - signer's
	fingerprint (%g), and signer's primary fingerprint (%p).

	* Makefile.am: Include W32LIBS where appropriate.

	* g10.c (main): Add --rfc2440 alias for --openpgp since in a few
	months, they won't be the same thing.

	* keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_uri): Accept "http" as an alias for
	"hkp", since it is occasionally written that way.
	(keyserver_spawn): Use ascii_isspace to avoid locale issues.

	* keygen.c (ask_user_id): Make --allow-freeform-uid apply to the
	email field as well as the name field, and allow mixing fields
	when it is set.

	* options.skel: Use subkeys.pgp.net as the default keyserver.

	* trustdb.c (validate_one_keyblock): Certifications on revoked or
	expired uids do not count in the web of trust.

	* signal.c (init_one_signal, pause_on_sigusr, do_block): Only use
	sigprocmask() if we have sigset_t, and only use sigaction() if we
	have struct sigaction.  This is for Forte c89 on Solaris which
	seems to define only the function call half of the two pairs by
	default.
	(pause_on_sigusr): Typo.
	(do_block): If we can't use sigprocmask() and sigset_t, try to get
	the number of signals from NSIG as well as MAXSIG, and if we
	can't, fail with an explanation.

	* signal.c, tdbio.c: Comment out the transaction code.  It was not
	used in this version, and was causing some build problems on
	quasi-posix platforms (Solaris and Forte c89).

	* keylist.c (list_keyblock_colon): Don't include validity values
	when listing secret keys since they can be incorrect and/or
	misleading.  This is a temporary kludge, and will be handled
	properly in 1.9/2.0.

	* mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print): Only show the "key available
	from" preferred keyserver line if the key is not currently
	present.

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids): Do not sign expired uids without --expert
	(same behavior as revoked uids).  Do not allow signing a user ID
	without a self-signature.  --expert overrides.  Add additional
	prompt to the signature level question.
	(menu_expire): When changing expiration dates, don't replace
	selfsigs on revoked uids since this would effectively unrevoke
	them. There is also no point in replacing expired selfsigs.  This
	is bug #181

2003-07-10  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com> (from Werner on stable branch)

	* g10.c (add_notation_data): Make sure that only ascii is passed
	to iscntrl.  Noted by Christian Biere.
	* getkey.c (classify_user_id2): Replaced isspace by spacep
	* keygen.c (ask_user_id): Ditto.
	(get_parameter_algo): Ditto.
	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu): Ditto.
	* tdbdump.c (import_ownertrust): Ditto.  s/isxdigit/hexdigitp/.
	* revoke.c (ask_revocation_reason):
	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Dito.

2003-06-10  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* parse-packet.c (parse): Disallow old style partial length for
	all key material packets to avoid possible corruption of keyrings.

2003-06-08  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* import.c (import_keys_internal): Invalidate the cache so that
	the file descriptor gets closed.  Fixes bug reported by Juan
	F. Codagnone.

2003-06-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.skel: Use new hkp://subkeys.pgp.net as sample keyserver
	since they at least handle subkeys correctly.

	* options.h, g10.c (main), main.h, keylist.c (show_keyserver_url),
	mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print), parse-packet.c (dump_sig_subpkt,
	parse_one_sig_subpkt, can_handle_critical): Add read-only support
	for preferred keyserver subpackets.  They're basically policy URLs
	with a different name.  Add a verify-option
	"show-preferred-keyserver" to turn them on and off (on by default,
	as per stable branch).

	* g10.c (main): Add "--set-notation" as alias to "--notation-data"
	this is to make things consistent with --set-policy-url meaning
	both sigs and certs.

2003-06-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main), keylist.c (list_keyblock_print): Add
	"show-validity" and "show-long-keyid" list-options.

	* gpgv.c (get_validity, trust_value_to_string): Stubs.

	* g10.c (main): Use SAFE_VERSION instead of VERSION in the
	version-specific gpg.conf file so it can be overridden on RISCOS.

2003-06-01  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (main), keylist.c (show_policy_url, show_notation),
	mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print): Emulate the old policy and
	notation behavior (display by default).  Send to status-fd whether
	it is displayed on the screen or not.

	* g10.c (main): Since we now have some options in devel that won't
	work in a stable branch gpg.conf file, try for a version-specific
	gpg.conf-VERSION file before falling back to gpg.conf.

	* main.h, options.h: Move various option flags to options.h.

2003-05-31  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print), main.h, keylist.c
	(show_policy, show_notation): Collapse the old print_notation_data
	into show_policy() and show_notation() so there is only one
	function to print notations and policy URLs.

	* options.h, main.h, g10.c (main), keyedit.c
	(print_and_check_one_sig), keylist.c (list_one,
	list_keyblock_print), pkclist.c (do_edit_ownertrust), sign.c
	(mk_notation_and_policy): New "list-options" and "verify-options"
	commands.  These replace the existing
	--show-photos/--no-show-photos,
	--show-notation/--no-show-notation,
	--show-policy-url/--no-show-policy-url, and --show-keyring
	options.  The new method is more flexible since a user can specify
	(for example) showing photos during sig verification, but not in
	key listings.  The old options are emulated.

	* main.h, misc.c (parse_options): New general option line
	parser. Fix the bug in the old version that did not handle report
	syntax errors after a valid entry.

	* import.c (parse_import_options), export.c
	(parse_export_options): Call it here instead of duplicating the
	code.

2003-05-30  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keylist.c (list_one): Don't show the keyring filename when in
	--with-colons mode.  Actually translate "Keyring" string.

	* mainproc.c (proc_tree): We can't currently handle multiple
	signatures of different classes or digests (we'd pretty much have
	to run a different hash context for each), but if they are all the
	same, make an exception.  This is Debian bug #194292.

	* sig-check.c (check_key_signature2): Make string translatable.

	* packet.h, getkey.c (fixup_uidnode): Mark real primary uids
	differently than assumed primaries.

	* keyedit.c (no_primary_warning): Use the differently marked
	primaries here in a new function to warn when an --edit-key
	command might rearrange the self-sig dates enough to change which
	uid is primary.
	(menu_expire, menu_set_preferences): Use no_primary_warning()
	here.

	* Makefile.am: Use @DLLIBS@ for -ldl.

2003-05-26  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* getkey.c (premerge_public_with_secret): Made "no secret subkey
	for" warning a verbose item and translatable. (From wk on stable
	branch)

	* sig-check.c (check_key_signature2): Made "no subkey for subkey
	binding packet" a verbose item instead of a !quiet one.  There are
	too many garbled keys out in the wild. (From wk on stable branch)

	* filter.h: Remove const from WHAT. (From wk on stable branch)

	* progress.c (handle_progress): Store a copy of
	NAME. (progress_filter): Release WHAT, make sure not to print a
	NULL WHAT. (From wk on stable branch)

	* openfile.c (open_sigfile): Adjust free for new progress
	semantics. (From wk on stable branch)

	* plaintext.c (ask_for_detached_datafile): Don't dealloc
	pfx->WHAT. (From wk on stable branch)

	* seckey-cert.c (do_check): Issue the RSA_OR_IDEA status when the
	cipher algo is IDEA to make it easier to track down the
	problem. (From twoaday on stable branch)

2003-05-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* armor.c, g10.c, kbnode.c, misc.c, pkclist.c, sign.c,
	build-packet.c, getkey.c, keydb.c, openfile.c, plaintext.c,
	status.c, gpgv.c, keygen.c, options.h, sig-check.c, tdbio.h,
	encode.c, mainproc.c, parse-packet.c, signal.c, textfilter.c: Edit
	all preprocessor instructions to remove whitespace before the '#'.
	This is not required by C89, but there are some compilers out
	there that don't like it.

2003-05-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* trustdb.h, trustdb.c (is_disabled), gpgv.c (is_disabled): Rename
	is_disabled to cache_disabled_value, which now takes a pk and not
	just the keyid. This is for speed since there is no need to
	re-fetch a key when we already have that key handy.  Cache the
	result of the check so we don't need to hit the trustdb more than
	once.

	* getkey.c (skip_disabled): New function to get a pk and call
	is_disabled on it. (key_byname): Use it here.

	* packet.h, getkey.c (skip_disabled), keylist.c
	(print_capabilities): New "pk_is_disabled" macro to retrieve the
	cached disabled value if available, and fill it in via
	cache_disabled_value if not available.

	* trustdb.c (get_validity): Cache the disabled value since we have
	it handy and it might be useful later.

	* parse-packet.c (parse_key): Clear disabled flag when parsing a
	new key.  Just in case someone forgets to clear the whole key.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main): Add an "if all else fails" path
	for setting a single user ID primary when there are multiple set
	primaries all at the same second, or no primaries set and the most
	recent user IDs are at the same second, or no signed user IDs at
	all. This is arbitrary, but deterministic.

	* exec.h, photoid.h: Add copyright message.

	* keylist.c (list_keyblock_print): Don't dump attribs for
	revoked/expired/etc uids for non-colon key listings.  This is for
	consistency with --show-photos.

	* main.h, keylist.c (dump_attribs), mainproc.c
	(check_sig_and_print): Dump attribs if --attrib-fd is set when
	verifying signatures.

	* g10.c (main): New --gnupg option to disable the various
	--openpgp, --pgpX, etc. options.  This is the same as --no-XXXX
	for those options.

	* revoke.c (ask_revocation_reason): Clear old reason if user
	elects to repeat question.  This is bug 153.

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids): Show keyid of the key making the
	signature.

2003-05-21  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* progress.c (handle_progress)
	* sign.c (write_plaintext_packet)
	* encode.c (encode_simple,encode_crypt): Make sure that a filename
	of "-" is considered to be stdin so that iobuf_get_filelength
	won't get called.  This fixes bug 156 reported by Gregery Barton.

2003-05-02  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* packet.h, build-packet.c (build_sig_subpkt), export.c
	(do_export_stream), import.c (remove_bad_stuff, import),
	parse-packet.c (dump_sig_subpkt, parse_one_sig_subpkt): Remove
	vestigal code for the old sig cache subpacket.  This wasn't
	completely harmless as it caused subpacket 101 to disappear on
	import and export.

	* options.h, armor.c, cipher.c, g10.c, keyedit.c, pkclist.c,
	sign.c, encode.c, getkey.c, revoke.c: The current flags for
	different levels of PGP-ness are massively complex.  This is step
	one in simplifying them. No functional change yet, just use a
	macro to check for compliance level.

	* sign.c (sign_file): Fix bug that causes spurious compression
	preference warning.

	* sign.c (clearsign_file): Fix bug that prevents proper warning
	message from appearing when clearsigning in --pgp2 mode with a
	non-v3 RSA key.

	* main.h, misc.c (compliance_option_string, compliance_string,
	compliance_failure), pkclist.c (build_pk_list), sign.c (sign_file,
	clearsign_file), encode.c (encode_crypt,
	write_pubkey_enc_from_list): New functions to put the "this
	message may not be usable...." warning in one place.

	* options.h, g10.c (main): Part two of the simplification.  Use a
	single enum to indicate what we are compliant to (1991, 2440,
	PGPx, etc.)

	* g10.c (main): Show errors for failure in export, send-keys,
	recv-keys, and refresh-keys.

	* options.h, g10.c (main): Give algorithm warnings for algorithms
	chosen against the --pgpX and --openpgp rules.

	* keydb.h, pkclist.c (algo_available): Make TIGER192 invalid in
	--openpgp mode.

	* sign.c (sign_file), pkclist.c (algo_available): Allow passing a
	hint of 0.

2003-05-01  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* tdbio.c (create_version_record): Only create new trustdbs with
	TM_CLASSIC or TM_PGP.

	* trustdb.h, trustdb.c (trust_string, get_ownertrust_string,
	get_validity_string, ask_ownertrust, validate_keys), pkclist.c
	(do_edit_ownertrust): Rename trust_string to trust_value_to_string
	for naming consistency.

	* trustdb.h, trustdb.c (string_to_trust_value): New function to
	translate a string to a trust value.

	* g10.c (main): Use string_to_trust_value here for
	--force-ownertrust.

	* options.h, g10.c (main), trustdb.c (trust_model_string,
	init_trustdb, check_trustdb, update_trustdb, get_validity,
	validate_one_keyblock): An "OpenPGP" trust model is misleading
	since there is no official OpenPGP trust model.  Use "PGP"
	instead.

2003-04-30  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* build-packet.c (build_sig_subpkt): Comments.

	* exec.c (exec_write): Cast NULL to void* to properly terminate
	varargs list.

	* keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names): Just for safety, catch an
	invalid pk algorithm.

	* sign.c (make_keysig_packet): Crucial that the call to mksubpkt
	comes LAST before the calls to finalize the sig as that makes it
	possible for the mksubpkt function to get a reliable pointer to
	the subpacket area.

	* pkclist.c (do_we_trust_pre): If an untrusted key was chosen by a
	particular user ID, use that ID as the one to ask about when
	prompting whether to use the key anyway.
	(build_pk_list): Similar change here when adding keys to the
	recipient list.

	* trustdb.c (update_validity): Fix bug that prevented more than
	one validity record per trust record.
	(get_validity): When retrieving validity for a (user) supplied
	user ID, return the validity for that user ID only, and do not
	fall back to the general key validity.
	(validate_one_keyblock): Some commentary on whether
	non-self-signed user IDs belong in the web of trust (arguably,
	they do).

2003-04-27  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (main): Add --no-textmode.

	* export.c (do_export_stream), keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names,
	menu_addrevoker), mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print), photoid.c
	(show_photos), sign.c (mk_notation_and_policy), trustdb.c
	(get_validity, reset_trust_records, validate_keys): Make some
	strings translatable.

	* mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print): Show digest algorithm and sig
	class when verifying a sig with --verbose on, and add version, pk
	and hash algorithms and sig class to VALIDSIG.

	* parse-packet.c (enum_sig_subpkt): Make a warning message a
	--verbose warning message since we don't need to warn every time
	we see an unknown critical (we only need to invalidate the
	signature).

	* trustdb.c (init_trustdb): Check the trustdb options even with

2003-04-10  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* passphrase.c (read_passphrase_from_fd): Do a dummy read if the
	agent is to be used.  Noted by Ingo Klöcker.
	(agent_get_passphrase): Inhibit caching when we have no
	fingerprint.  This is required for key generation as well as for
	symmetric only encryption.

	* passphrase .c (agent_get_passphrase): New arg CANCELED.
	(passphrase_to_dek): Ditto.  Passed to above.  Changed all
	callers to pass NULL.
	* seckey-cert.c (do_check): New arg CANCELED.

	used to re-loop with same file after an error.  Reported by Joseph
	Walton.

2003-04-08  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* main.h, g10.c (main), import.c (parse_import_options,
	fix_pks_corruption): It's really PKS corruption, not HKP
	corruption.  Keep the old repair-hkp-subkey-bug command as an
	alias.

	* g10.c (main): Rename --no-version to --no-emit-version for
	consistency.  Keep --no-version as an alias.

2003-04-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* pkclist.c (algo_available): PGP 8 can use the SHA-256 hash.

	unused code.

2003-04-01  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print): Add primary key fpr to VALIDSIG
	status.

2003-03-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keydb.h: Err on the side of making an unknown signature a SIG
	rather than a CERT.

	* import.c (delete_inv_parts): Discard any key signatures that
	aren't key types (i.e. 0x00, 0x01, etc.)

	keyserver option.  Defaults to on.

	* passphrase.c (agent_get_passphrase): Fix memory leak with
	symmetric messages.  Fix segfault with symmetric messages.  Fix
	incorrect prompt with symmetric messages.

2003-03-10  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* compress.c (init_uncompress): Use a 15 bit window size so that
	the output of implementations which don't run for PGP 2
	compatibility won't get garbled.

2003-03-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* trustdb.c (validate_keys): Mask the ownertrust when building the
	list of fully valid keys so that disabled keys are still counted
	in the web of trust.
	(get_ownertrust_with_min): Do the same for the minimum ownertrust
	calculation.

	* parse-packet.c (dump_sig_subpkt): Show the notation names for

	are using capabilities.

2003-02-26  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Include various pieces of
	information about the key in the data sent to the keyserver
	helper.  This allows the helper to use it in instructing a remote
	server which may not have any actual OpenPGP smarts in parsing
	keys.

	* main.h, export.c (export_pubkeys_stream, do_export_stream): Add
	ability to return only the first match in an exported keyblock for
	keyserver usage.  This should be replaced at some point with a
	more flexible solution where each key can be armored seperately.

2003-02-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* sign.c (sign_file): Do not push textmode filter onto an unopened
	IOBUF (segfault).  Noted by Marcus Brinkmann.  Push and
	reinitialize textmode filter for each file in a multiple file
	list.

	* packet.h, getkey.c (fixup_uidnode), keyedit.c (show_prefs): Set
	and show the keyserver no-modify flag.

	* g10.c (main): Accept "s1" in addition to "idea" to match the
	other ciphers.

	* main.h, misc.c (idea_cipher_warn): We don't need this if IDEA
	has been disabled.

2003-02-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (keygen_set_std_prefs): Don't put AES or CAST5 in
	default prefs if they are disabled.

	* g10.c (main): Use 3DES instead of CAST5 if we don't have CAST5
	support.  Use 3DES for the s2k cipher in --openpgp mode.
	(print_mds): #ifdef all of the optional digest algorithms.

2003-02-12  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keydb.h, getkey.c (classify_user_id, classify_user_id2): Make
	'exact' a per-desc item.  Merge into one function since
	'force_exact' is no longer needed.
	(key_byname): Use new classify_user_id function, and new exact
	flag in KEYDB_SEARCH_DESC.

	* keyring.h, keyring.c (keyring_search): Return an optional index
	to show which KEYDB_SEARCH_DESC was the matching one.

	* keydb.h, keydb.c (keydb_search): Rename to keydb_search2, and
	pass the optional index to keyring_search.  Add a macro version of
	keydb_search that calls this new function.

	* export.c (do_export_stream): If the keyid! syntax is used,
	export only that specified key.  If the key in question is a
	subkey, export the primary plus that subkey only.

2003-02-11  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* exec.c (set_exec_path): Add debugging line.

	* g10.c (print_hex, print_mds): Print long hash strings a lot
	neater.  This assumes at least an 80-character display, as there
	are a few other similar assumptions here and there.  Users who
	need unformatted hashes can still use with-colons.  Check that
	SHA384 and 512 are available before using them as they are no
	longer always available.

	* Makefile.am: Use a local copy of libexecdir along with @PACKAGE@
	as GNUPG_LIBEXECDIR so it can be easily overridden at make time.

2003-02-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* armor.c (parse_hash_header, armor_filter): Accept the new SHAs
	in the armor Hash: header.

2003-01-27  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* mainproc.c (list_node): Show signature expiration date in
	with-colons sig records.

	* keylist.c (list_keyblock_colon), mainproc.c (list_node): Show
	trust sig information in with-colons sig records.

2003-01-16  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (add_group): Trim whitespace after a group name so it does
	not matter where the user puts the = sign.

	* options.skel: Comment out the first three lines in case someone
	manually copies the skel file to their homedir.

	* sign.c (clearsign_file): Only use pgp2mode with v3 keys and
	MD5. This matches what we do when decoding such messages and
	prevents creating a message (v3+RIPEMD/160) that we can't verify.

	* sig-check.c (signature_check2): Use G10ERR_GENERAL as the error
	for signature digest conflict.  BAD_SIGN implies that a signature
	was checked and we may try and print out a user ID for a key that
	doesn't exist.

2003-01-15  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* trustdb.c (init_trustdb, get_validity): Don't use a changed

	dirty trustdb with the "always" trust model.

	* g10.c (add_group): Last commit missed the \t ;)

2003-01-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	to rmd160-hash the contents of a user ID packet and cache it in
	the uid object.

	* keylist.c (list_keyblock_colon): Use namehash in field 8 of
	uids.  Show dates for creation (selfsig date), and expiration in
	fields 6 and 7.

	* trustdb.c (get_validity, get_validity_counts, update_validity):
	Use new namehash function rather than hashing it locally.

2003-01-14  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* g10.c (add_group): Fixed group parsing to allow more than one
	delimiter in a row and also allow tab as delimiter.

2003-01-12  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* tdbio.c (tdbio_set_dbname): Fix assertion failure with
	non-fully-qualified trustdb names.

2003-01-11  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* trustdb.c (get_validity_info, get_ownertrust_info,
	trust_letter): Simplify by returning a ? for error directly.

	* keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names): Use get_validity_string and
	get_ownertrust_string to show full word versions of trust
	(i.e. "full" instead of 'f').

	* trustdb.h, trustdb.c (get_ownertrust_string,
	get_validity_string): Same as get_ownertrust_info, and
	get_validity_info, except returns a full string.

	* trustdb.c (get_ownertrust_with_min): New.  Same as
	'get_ownertrust' but takes the min_ownertrust value into account.

2003-01-10  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* armor.c (armor_filter): Comment about PGP's end of line tab
	problem.

	* trustdb.h, trustdb.c (trust_letter): Make
	static. (get_ownertrust_info, get_validity_info): Don't mask the
	trust level twice.

	* trustdb.h, gpgv.c, trustdb.c (get_validity, get_validity_info),
	keylist.c (list_keyblock_colon), keyedit.c
	(show_key_with_all_names_colon, menu_revuid): Pass a user ID in
	rather than a namehash, so we only have to do the hashing in one
	place.

	* packet.h, pkclist.c (build_pk_list), free-packet.c
	(release_public_key_parts): Remove unused namehash element for
	public keys.

2003-01-07  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (keygen_set_std_prefs): Warn when setting an IDEA
	preference when IDEA is not available.

2003-01-06  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	validity value any more.

	* packet.h, tdbio.h, tdbio.c (tdbio_read_record,
	tdbio_write_record), trustdb.c (update_validity): Store temporary
	full & marginal counts in the trustdb.
	(clear_validity, get_validity_counts): Return and clear temp
	counts.
	(store_validation_status): Keep track of which keyids have been
	stored.
	(validate_one_keyblock, validate_key_list): Use per-uid copies of
	the full & marginal counts so they can be recalled for multiple
	levels.
	(validate_keys): Only use unused keys for each new round.
	(reset_unconnected_keys): Rename to reset_trust_records, and only
	skip specifically excluded records.

	* keylist.c (print_capabilities): Show 'D' for disabled keys in
	capabilities section.

	* trustdb.c (is_disabled): Remove incorrect comment.

2003-01-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* import.c (import_one): Only do the work to create the status
	display for interactive import if status is enabled.

	* keyring.c (keyring_search): skipfnc didn't work properly with
	non-keyid searches.  Noted by Stefan Bellon.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main): Remove some unused code and make
	sure that the pk selfsigversion member accounts for 1F direct
	sigs.

2003-01-02  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* keydb.c (keydb_add_resource): Don't assume that try_make_homedir

	continue then.
	* openfile.c (copy_options_file): Print a warning if the skeleton
	file has active options.

2002-12-29  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main), main.h, sig-check.c
	(check_key_signature2): Pass the ultimately trusted pk directly to
	check_key_signature2 to avoid going through the key selection
	mechanism.  This prevents a deadly embrace when two keys without
	selfsigs each sign the other.

2002-12-27  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_refresh): Don't print the "refreshing..."
	line if there are no keys to refresh or if there is no keyserver
	set.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main): Any valid user ID should make a
	key valid, not just the last one.  This also fixes Debian bug
	#174276.

2002-12-27  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* import.c (print_import_check): Changed int to size_t.

2002-12-27  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu, menu_revuid): Add "revuid" feature to
	revoke a user ID.  This is the same as issuing a revocation for
	the self-signature, but a much simpler interface to do it.

2002-12-26  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keydb.h, getkey.c (key_byname): Flag to enable or disable
	including disabled keys.  Keys specified via keyid (i.e. 0x...)
	are always included.

	* getkey.c (get_pubkey_byname, get_seckey_byname2,
	get_seckey_bynames), keyedit.c (keyedit_menu, menu_addrevoker):
	Include disabled keys in these functions.

	don't repeat some key information twice.

2002-12-22  Timo Schulz  <ts@winpt.org>

	* import.c (print_import_check): New.
	(import_one): Use it here.

	* status.c: Ditto.

2002-12-13  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	user" rather than "owner".  Noted by Stefan Bellon.

	* trustdb.h, trustdb.c (trustdb_pending_check): New function to
	check if the trustdb needs a check.

	* import.c (import_keys_internal): Used here so we don't rebuild
	the trustdb if it is still clean.
	(import_one, chk_self_sigs): Only mark trustdb dirty if the key
	that is being imported has any sigs other than self-sigs.
	Suggested by Adrian von Bidder.

	* options.skel: Include the required '=' sign in the sample
	'group' option.  Noted by Stefan Bellon.

	* import.c (chk_self_sigs): Don't try and check a subkey as if it
	was a signature.

	* tdbio.c (tdbio_read_record, tdbio_write_record): Compact the
	RECTYPE_TRUST records a bit.

	* g10.c (main): Comment out --list-trust-path until it can be
	implemented.

	* import.c (import_one): Warn when importing an Elgamal primary
	that this may take some time (to verify self-sigs).
	(chk_self_sigs): Try and cache all self-sigs so the keyblock is
	written to the keyring with a good rich cache.

	* keygen.c (ask_algo): Make the Elgamal sign+encrypt warning
	stronger, and remove the RSA sign+encrypt warning.

2002-12-06  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* options.h: Fixed typo (mangle_dos_names instead of
	mangle_dos_filenames).

2002-12-05  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* main.h, keyedit.c, keygen.c: Back out previous (2002-12-01)
	change.  Minimal isn't always best.

	* sign.c (update_keysig_packet): Use the current time rather then
	a modification of the original signature time.  Make sure that
	this doesn't cause a time warp.

	* keygen.c (keygen_add_key_expire): Properly handle a key
	expiration date in the past (use a duration of 0).

	* keyedit.c (menu_expire): Use update_keysig_packet so any sig

	* trustdb.c (validate_keys): Call tdbio_update_version_record on
	success so that the correct options are stored in the trustdb.

	* options.h: rearrange trust models so that CLASSIC is 0 and
	OPENPGP is 1.

	* options.h, g10.c (main), encode.c (write_pubkey_enc_from_list),
	pkclist.c (algo_available), revoke.c (gen_revoke): Add --pgp8
	mode.  This is basically identical to --pgp7 in all ways except
	that signing subkeys, v4 data sigs (including expiration), and SK
	comments are allowed.

	* getkey.c (finish_lookup): Comment.

	* main.h, keylist.c (reorder_keyblock), keyedit.c (keyedit_menu):
	Reorder user ID display in the --edit-key menu to match that of

2002-12-01  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (menu_expire): Don't lose key flags when changing the

	flags, if any, from one sig to another.
	(do_add_key_expire): New function to add key expiration to a sig.

	keygen_add_key_expire that also copies key flags.
	(keygen_add_key_flags_and_expire): Use do_add_key_expire.

	* import.c (fix_hkp_corruption): Comment.

2002-11-25  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* plaintext.c (handle_plaintext) [__riscos__]: If nooutput is set,
	no filetype is needed obviously.

2002-11-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* main.h, misc.c (default_cipher_algo, default_compress_algo):
	New.  Return the default algorithm by trying
	--cipher-algo/--compress-algo, then the first item in the pref
	list, then s2k-cipher-algo or ZIP.

	* sign.c (sign_file, sign_symencrypt_file), encode.c
	(encode_simple, encode_crypt): Call default_cipher_algo and
	default_compress_algo to get algorithms.

	* g10.c (main): Allow pref selection for compress algo with
	--openpgp.

	* mainproc.c (proc_encrypted): Use --s2k-digest-algo for
	passphrase mangling rather than --digest-algo.

	* sign.c (hash_for): If --digest-algo is not set, but
	--personal-digest-preferences is, then use the first hash
	algorithm in the personal list.  If the signing algorithm is DSA,
	then use the first 160-bit hash algorithm in the personal list.
	If --pgp2 is set and it's a v3 RSA key, use MD5.

	* g10.c (main), keydb.c (keydb_add_resource,
	keydb_locate_writable): Rename --default-keyring as
	--primary-keyring.  Stefan wins the naming contest.

2002-11-23  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (add_notation_data): Disallow notation names that do not
	contain a '@', unless --expert is set.  This is to help prevent
	people from polluting the (as yet unused) IETF namespace.

	* main.h: Comments about default algorithms.

	* photoid.c (image_type_to_string): Comments about 3-letter file
	extensions.

	* encode.c (encode_simple), passphrase.c (passphrase_to_dek),
	sign.c (sign_symencrypt_file): Use --s2k-digest-algo for
	passphrase mangling rather than --digest-algo.

2002-11-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (keygen_set_std_prefs): Properly handle an empty
	preference string.

	* misc.c (string_to_compress_algo): "none" is a bad choice since
	it conflicts with the "none" in setpref.

2002-11-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (main): Allow compression algorithm names as the argument
	to --compress-algo.  The old algorithm names still work for
	backwards compatibility.

	* misc.c (string_to_compress_algo): Allow "none" as an alias for
	"uncompressed".

2002-11-13  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* getkey.c (get_pubkey_byfprint_fast): Fixed type incompatibility,
	was unsigned char instead of byte.

2002-11-13  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* encode.c (encode_simple): Make sure that files larger than about
	4G use partial length encoding.  This is required because OpenPGP
	allows only for 32 bit length fields.  From Werner on stable
	branch.

	* getkey.c (get_pubkey_direct): Renamed to...
	(get_pubkey_fast): this and made extern.
	(get_pubkey_byfprint_fast): New.  From Werner on stable branch.

	* keydb.h, import.c (import_one): Use get_pubkey_fast instead of
	get_pubkey.  We don't need a merged key and actually this might
	lead to recursions.
	(revocation_present): Likewise for search by fingerprint.  From
	Werner on stable branch.

	* g10.c (main): Try to create the trustdb even for non-colon-mode
	list-key operations.  This is required because getkey needs to
	know whether a a key is ultimately trusted.  From Werner on stable
	branch.

	* exec.c [__CYGWIN32__]: Keep cygwin separate from Mingw32;
	we don't need it here as it behaves more like a Posix system.
	From Werner on stable branch.

	* passphrase.c (agent_get_passphrase): Ditto.  From Werner on
	stable branch.

	* tdbio.c (MY_O_BINARY): Need binary mode with Cygwin.  From
	Werner on stable branch.

	* g10.c, gpgv.c (main) [__CYGWIN32__]: Don't get the homedir from
	the registry.  From Werner on stable branch.

	* keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names_colon): Make --with-colons
	--edit display match the validity and trust of --with-colons
	--list-keys.

	* passphrase.c (agent_send_all_options): Fix compile warning.

	* keylist.c (list_keyblock_colon): Validity for subkeys should
	match that of the primary key, and not that of the last user ID.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs): Revoked/expired/invalid primary keys
	carry these facts onto all their subkeys, but only after the
	subkey has a chance to be marked valid.  This is to fix an
	incorrect "invalid public key" error verifying a signature made by
	a revoked signing subkey, with a valid unrevoked primary key.

2002-11-09  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* passphrase.c (agent_send_all_options): Use tty_get_ttyname to
	get the default ttyname.

2002-11-07  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyring.h, keyring.c (keyring_register_filename): Return the
	pointer if a given keyring is registered twice.

	* keydb.h, keydb.c (keydb_add_resource): Use flags to indicate a
	default keyring.
	(keydb_locate_writable): Prefer the default keyring if possible.

	* g10.c (main): Add --default-keyring option.

2002-11-06  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main), trustdb.c (ask_ownertrust): Add
	--force-ownertrust option for debugging purposes.  This allows
	setting a whole keyring to a given trust during an
	--update-trustdb.  Not for normal use - it's just easier than
	hitting "4" all the time to test a large trustdb.

	* pubkey-enc.c (get_session_key): With hidden recipients or try a
	given passphrase against all secret keys rather than trying all
	secret keys in turn.  Don't if --try-all-secrets or --status-fd is
	enabled.

	* passphrase.c (passphrase_to_dek): Mode 1 means do a regular
	passphrase query, but don't prompt with the key info.

	* seckey-cert.c (do_check, check_secret_key): A negative ask count
	means to enable passphrase mode 1.

	* keydb.h, getkey.c (enum_secret_keys): Add flag to include
	secret-parts-missing keys (or not) in the list.

2002-11-05  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_search_prompt): When --with-colons is
	enabled, don't try and fit the search output to the screen size -
	just dump the whole list.

2002-11-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_search_prompt): When --with-colons is
	enabled, just dump the raw keyserver protocol to stdout and don't
	print the menu.

	* keyserver.c (show_prompt): Don't show a prompt when command-fd
	is being used.

	* trustdb.c (trust_model_string, check_trustdb, update_trustdb,
	validate_one_keyblock): It's not clear what a trustdb rebuild or
	check means with a trust model other than "classic" or "openpgp",
	so disallow this.

2002-11-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main): Add --trust-model option.  Current
	models are "openpgp" which is classic+trustsigs, "classic" which
	is classic only, and "always" which is the same as the current
	option --always-trust (which still works).  Default is "openpgp".

	* trustdb.c (validate_one_keyblock): Use "openpgp" trust model to
	enable trust sigs.

	* gpgv.c (main), mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print), pkclist.c
	(do_we_trust, do_we_trust_pre, check_signatures_trust): Use new
	--trust-model option in place of --always-trust.

	* keyedit.c (sign_mk_attrib, trustsig_prompt, sign_uids,
	keyedit_menu): Prompt for and create a trust signature with
	"tsign".  This is functional, but needs better UI text.

	* build-packet.c (build_sig_subpkt): Able to build trust and
	regexp subpackets.

	* pkclist.c (do_edit_ownertrust): Comment.

2002-11-02  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (set_one_pref, keygen_set_std_prefs): Allow using the
	full algorithm name (CAST5, SHA1) rather than the short form (S3,
	H2).

	* main.h, keygen.c (keygen_get_std_prefs), keyedit.c
	(keyedit_menu): Return and use a fake uid packet rather than a
	string since we already have a nice parser/printer in
	keyedit.c:show_prefs.

	* main.h, misc.c (string_to_compress_algo): New.

2002-11-01  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (main): Add --no-throw-keyid.

	* keydb.h, encode.c (write_pubkey_enc_from_list), g10.c (main),
	pkclist.c (build_pk_list): Add --hidden-recipient (-R) and
	--hidden-encrypt-to, which do a single-user variation on
	--throw-keyid.  The "hide this key" flag is carried in bit 0 of
	the pk_list flags field.

	* keyserver.c (parse_keyrec): Fix shadowing warning.

2002-10-31  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* compress.c (init_compress) [__riscos__]: Use
	riscos_load_module() to load ZLib module.

	* g10.c (main) [__riscos__]: Renames due to changes in riscos.c
	(e.g. prefixes all RISC OS specific functions with riscos_*).
	* photoid.c (show_photos) [__riscos__]: Likewise.
	* signal.c (got_fatal_signal) [__riscos__]: Likewise.

	* trustdb.c (check_regexp) [__riscos__]: Branch to RISC OS RegEx
	handling.

2002-10-31  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* build-packet.c (do_plaintext), encode.c (encode_sesskey,
	encode_simple, encode_crypt), sign.c (write_plaintext_packet): Use
	wipememory() instead of memset() to wipe sensitive memory as the
	memset() might be optimized away.

2002-10-30  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* trustdb.c (check_regexp): Modern regexps require REG_EXTENDED.

2002-10-29  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* packet.h, trustdb.h, trustdb.c (trust_string): New.  Return a
	string like "fully trusted", "marginally trusted", etc.
	(get_min_ownertrust): New.  Return minimum ownertrust.
	(update_min_ownertrust): New.  Set minimum ownertrust.
	(check_regexp): New.  Check a regular epression against a user ID.
	(ask_ownertrust): Allow specifying a minimum value.
	(get_ownertrust_info): Follow the minimum ownertrust when
	returning a letter.
	(clear_validity): Remove minimum ownertrust when a key becomes
	invalid.
	(release_key_items): Release regexp along with the rest of the
	info.

	while validating.  Call check_regexp for regexps.  Use the minimum
	ownertrust if the user does not specify a genuine ownertrust.

	* pkclist.c (do_edit_ownertrust): Only allow user to select a
	trust level greater than the minimum value.

	* parse-packet.c (can_handle_critical): Can handle critical trust
	and regexp subpackets.

	* trustdb.h, trustdb.c (clear_ownertrusts), delkey.c
	(do_delete_key), import.c (import_one): Rename clear_ownertrust to
	clear_ownertrusts and have it clear the min_ownertrust value as
	well.

	* keylist.c (list_keyblock_print): Indent uid to match pub and
	sig.

	* keyedit.c (print_and_check_one_sig, show_key_and_fingerprint,
	menu_addrevoker), keylist.c (list_keyblock_print,
	print_fingerprint): Show "T" or the trust depth for trust
	signatures, and add spaces to some strings to make room for it.

	* packet.h, parse-packet.c (dump_sig_subpkt, parse_one_sig_subpkt,
	parse_signature): Parse trust signature values.

	* tdbio.h, tdbio.c (tdbio_read_record, tdbio_write_record):
	Reserve a byte for the minimum ownertrust value (for use with
	trust signatures).

2002-10-29  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* build-packet.c (calc_plaintext, do_plaintext): Removed RISC OS
	specific filetype parts (it's now done in make_basename()).

	* plaintext.c (handle_plaintext): Tidied up RISC OS specific
	filetype parts.

	* encode.c (encode_simple, encode_crypt): Added argument to
	make_basename() call.

	* sign.c (write_plaintext_packet): Added argument to
	make_basename() call.

	handling for RISC OS' file types.

	* plaintext.c (handle_plaintext) [__riscos__]: Added filetype
	handling for RISC OS' file types.

2002-10-23  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* main.h, import.c (sec_to_pub_keyblock, import_secret_one,
	parse_import_options), g10.c (main): New import-option
	"convert-sk-to-pk" to convert a secret key into a public key
	during import.  It is on by default.

2002-10-23  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* pubkey-enc.c (get_it): Fix segv, test for revoked only when PK
	has been assigned.

2002-10-18  Timo Schulz  <ts@winpt.org>

	* keylist.c: (print_pubkey_info): New.
	(print_seckey_info): New.
	* main.h: Prototypes for the new functions.
	* delkey.c (do_delete_key): Use it here.
	* revoke.c (gen_desig_revoke): Ditto.

2002-10-17  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* pkclist.c (do_edit_ownertrust): Show all user IDs.  This should
	be enhanced to also show the current trust level.  Suggested by
	Florian Weimer.

2002-10-17  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (main): Handle --strict and --no-strict from the command
	line before the options file is loaded.

2002-10-15  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (main): Disable --textmode when encrypting (symmetric or
	pk) in --pgp2 mode as PGP 2 can't handle the unknown length
	literal packet.  Reported by Michael Richardson.

2002-10-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver-internal.h, keyserver.c (print_keyrec, parse_keyrec,
	show_prompt, keyserver_search_prompt, keyserver_spawn): Go to
	version 1 of the keyserver protocol.  This is a better design,
	similar to --with-colons, that allows for keys with multiple user
	IDs rather than using multiple keys.  It also matches the machine
	readable pksd format.  Also use a prettier --search-keys listing
	format that can fill different size windows (currently set at 24
	lines).

2002-10-12  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* keygen.c (print_status_key_created): New.
	(do_generate_keypair): Use it to print the fingerprint.

2002-10-11  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (menu_addrevoker): Properly back out if the signature
	fails.  Also, do not allow appointing the same revoker twice, and
	report ALREADY_SIGNED if the user tries it.

2002-10-07  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* import.c (import_keys_internal): Missed one s/inp/inp2/.

	* keylist.c (print_capabilities): Properly indicate per-key
	capabilities of sign&encrypt primary keys that have
	secret-parts-missing (i.e. no capabilities at all)

	* mainproc.c (symkey_decrypt_sesskey): Fix compiler warning.

2002-10-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* getkey.c (get_pubkey_direct): Don't cache keys retrieved via
	this function as they may not have all their fields filled in.

	* sig-check.c (signature_check2): Use new is_primary flag to check
	rather than comparing main_keyid with keyid as this still works in
	the case of a not fully filled in pk.

2002-10-04  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* import.c (import_keys_internal): s/inp/inp2/ to avoid shadowing
	warning.

	* passphrase.c (agent_get_passphrase): Fixed signed/unsigned char
	problem in %-escaping.  Noted by Ingo Klöcker.

2002-10-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main): Add --strict and --no-strict to switch
	the log_warning severity level from info to error.

	* keylist.c (print_capabilities): Secret-parts-missing keys should
	show that fact in the capabilities, and only primary signing keys
	can certify other keys.

	* packet.h, parse_packet.c (parse_key): Add is_primary flag for
	public keys (it already exists for secret keys).

2002-10-02  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* import.c (import_secret_one): Check for an illegal (>110)
	protection cipher when importing a secret key.

	secret-parts-missing key.

	* parse_packet.c (parse_key): Some comments.

	* revoke.c (gen_revoke): Remove some debugging code.

	* trustdb.c (verify_own_keys): Make trusted-key a non-deprecated
	option again.

	* seckey-cert.c (do_check): Don't give the IDEA warning unless the
	cipher in question is in fact IDEA.

2002-10-01  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* import.c (import_one): Make sure that a newly imported key
	starts with a clean ownertrust.

2002-10-01  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* getkey.c (get_pubkey_direct): New.
	(merge_selfsigs_main): Use it here to look for an ultimately
	trusted key.  Using the full get_pubkey might lead to an
	infinitive recursion.

	* keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_uri): Force the keyserver URI
	scheme to lowercase to be case-insensitive.

	this.
	* gpgv.c (set_homedir): Ditto.

2002-09-25  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am: Link gpg with EGDLIBS (i.e. NETLIBS) as EGD uses
	sockets.  Remove the old NETLIBS variable since the keyserver
	stuff is no longer internal.

2002-09-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* import.c (import_keys_stream): Fix compiler type warning.

	* keyring.c (keyring_rebuild_cache), sig-check.c
	(check_key_signature2), import.c (import, chk_self_sigs): Minor
	language cleanups.

2002-09-23  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	Avoided function clone by introducing import_keys_internal.

2002-09-19  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Properly handle line truncation.
	Don't leak memory (~10-20 bytes) on searches.
	(keyserver_search_prompt): Cleanup.

	* keylist.c (list_keyblock_colon): Show 1F direct key signatures
	in --with-colons listing.

2002-09-16  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (menu_addrevoker): The direct key signature for
	revocation keys must be at least v4 to carry the revocation key
	subpacket.  Add a PGP 2.x warning for revocation keys.

2002-09-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (check_permissions): Rearrange strings to make translating
	easier (don't incorporate string parts).

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids): Make strings translatable.

	* sig-check.c (check_key_signature2): Make string translatable.

2002-09-13  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* getkey.c (check_revocation_keys): Move....
	* main.h, sig-check.c (check_revocation_keys): to here.  Also
	return the signature_check error code rather than 0/1 and cache
	the sig result.

	check_revocation_keys if a revocation sig is made by someone other
	than the pk owner.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main): Tidy.

	* tdbio.c (tdbio_set_dbname, open_db): Use new macro MY_O_BINARY
	to avoid silly ifdefs.
	(open_db): Fallback to RDONLY so that gpg may be used from a
	RO-medium.

	(keyserver_work) [!DISABLE_KEYSERVER_HELPERS]: Exclude the unused
	code.

2002-09-09  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* parse-packet.c (make_attribute_uidname): Add new ar MAX_NAMELEN
	for sanity checks.  Changed both callers. Limit the size of an %s.

	* options.skel: Comment lock-once out, so that this file does not
	change anything when copied to a new home directory.
	* openfile.c (try_make_homedir): Don't exit after copying the
	option skeleton.

	* options.h: Don't use a comma when declaring variables over more
	than one line.

	* mainproc.c (symkey_decrypt_sesskey): Check length of the session
	key.

	* hkp.c (dehtmlize): Use ascii_tolower to protect against weird
	locales.  Cast the argument for isspace for the sake of broken
	HP/UXes.
	(parse_hkp_index): s/ascii_memcasecmp/ascii_strncasecmp/.

	* g10.c: Removed option --emulate-3des-s2k-bug.

	* passphrase.c (hash_passphrase): Was used here.

	* export.c (parse_export_options)
	* keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_options)
	* import.c (parse_import_options)
	* g10.c (check_permissions): s/ascii_memcasecmp/ascii_strncasecmp/.

2002-09-09  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (add_group): Use '=' to separate group name from group
	members.  Use a better error message for when no = is found.

	* hkp.c (hkp_export): Use CRLF in headers.

2002-09-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* mainproc.c (print_pkenc_list): Don't increment the error counter
	when printing the list of keys a message was encrypted to.  This
	would make gpg give a non-zero exit code even for completely valid
	messages if the message was encrypted to more than one key that
	the user owned.

2002-09-02  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* g10.c (main): Try to set a default character set.  Print the
	used one in verbosity level 3.
	* gpgv.c (main): Try to set a default character set.

	* status.c, status.h (STATUS_IMPORT_OK): New.
	* import.c (import_one,import_secret_one): Print new status.

2002-08-30  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* pkclist.c (build_pk_list): Add new status code to indicate an
	untrusted user.  This (or a disabled key) fail with "unavailable
	pubkey" (G10ERR_UNU_PUBKEY).

	* pkclist.c (build_pk_list): Fail if any recipient keys are
	unusable.

	* options.skel: The PGP LDAP keyserver is back.  Use MIT keyserver
	as a sample rather than cryptnet as cryptnet does not support
	searching yet.

	* keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names): Fix error message
	(preferences are userid/selfsig and not key specific).

2002-08-30  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* pkclist.c (do_we_trust_pre): Changed the wording of a warning.

	* encode.c (encode_simple,encode_crypt): Use new style CTB for
	compressssed packets when using MDC.  We need to do this so that
	concatenated messages are properly decrypted.  Old style
	compression assumes that it is the last packet; given that we
	can't determine the length in advance, the uncompressor does not
	know where to start.  Actually we should use the new CTB always
	but this would break PGP 2 compatibility.

	* parse-packet.c (parse): Special treatment for new style CTB
	compressed packets.

	* build-packet.c (do_mdc): Removed. Was not used.
	(do_encrypted_mdc): Count in the version number and the MDC packet.

2002-08-28  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* sig-check.c (do_check_messages, do_check): Show keyid in error
	messages.

	* keyserver.c (print_keyinfo): More readable key listings for
	--search-keys responses.

2002-08-26  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* hkp.c (parse_hkp_index, dehtmlize): Move HTML functionality into
	new "dehtmlize" function.  Remove HTML before trying to parse each
	line from the keyserver.  If the keyserver provides key type
	information in the listing, use it.

2002-08-23  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* sig-check.c (do_check, do_check_messages): Emit the usual sig
	warnings even for cached sigs.  This also serves to protect
	against missing a sig expiring while cached.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main): Don't check UID self-sigs twice.

2002-08-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* import.c (clean_subkeys, chk_self_sigs): Merge clean_subkeys
	into chk_self_sigs.  This improves efficiency as the same
	signatures are not checked multiple times.  Clarify when a subkey
	is revoked (any revocation signature, even if it is dated before
	the binding signature).

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_subkey): Subkey revocation comments.

	* keylist.c (list_one): Stats are only for public key listings.

	* g10.c (main), options.skel: Default should be include-revoked
	for keyserver operations.

2002-08-21  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* import.c (import_print_stats): Print new non_imported counter
	which is currently not used because we terminate on errors.

2002-08-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.skel: Document no-include-attributes for
	keyserver-options.

	* keylist.c, keyedit.c, keyserver.c, sign.c: Some TODOs and
	comments.

	* export.c (do_export_stream): Fix noop bug in exporting sensitive
	revocation keys.

	* pkclist.c (do_edit_ownertrust): Comment out the option for
	showing trust paths until it can be implemented.

2002-08-19  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* getkey.c (get_user_id_native): Renamed to ..
	(get_user_id_printable): this.  Filter out all dangerous
	characters.  Checked all usages.
	(get_user_id_string_native): Renamed to..
	(get_user_id_string_printable): this.  Filter out all dangerous
	characters.  Checked all usages.
	* keyedit.c (show_basic_key_info): New.
	* keylist.c (print_fingerprint): New mode 3.
	* import.c (import_one): Use new function to display the user ID.

2002-08-16  Timo Schulz  <ts@winpt.org>

	* g10.c (main): Enable opt.interactive.

	* import.c (import_one): Ask the user if the key shall be
	imported when the interactive mode is used. Useful to extract
	selected keys from a file.

2002-08-16  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* seckey-cert.c: Workaround to allow decryption of v3 keys created
	with a bug in the mpi_get_secure_buffer.

2002-08-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* hkp.c (parse_hkp_index): Properly handle really large keys
	(5 digit key length) in HKP searches.

2002-08-13  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* encode.c (encode_simple): Fix problem with using compression
	algo 2 and symmetric compressed files.

	* encode.c (encode_simple, encode_crypt): If we are not using a
	MDC, compress even if a file is already compressed.  This is to
	help against the chosen ciphertext attack.

	* pkclist.c (select_algo_from_prefs): Fix requested algorithm bug
	so the request succeeds even if the requested algorithm is not the
	first found.

	* cipher.c (write_header), encode.c (use_mdc, encode_simple,
	encode_crypt, encrypt_filter), g10.c (main): Be more eager to use
	a MDC.  We use a MDC if the keys directly support it, if the keys
	list AES (any) or TWOFISH anywhere in the prefs, or if the cipher
	chosen does not have a 64 bit blocksize.

2002-08-08  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.skel: Some language tweaks, and remove the
	load-extension section for random gatherers.

	* keyring.c (create_tmp_file, rename_tmp_file): Create tmp files
	with user-only permissions, but restore the original permissions
	if the user has something special set.

	* openfile.c (copy_options_file): Create new options file
	(gpg.conf) with user-only permissions.

	* keydb.c (keydb_add_resource): Create new keyrings with user-only
	permissions.

	* tdbio.c (tdbio_set_dbname): Create new trustdbs with user-only
	permissions.

2002-08-07  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* sig-check.c (signature_check2): Sanity check that the md has a
	context for the hash that the sig is expecting.  This can happen
	if a onepass sig header does not match the actual sig, and also if
	the clearsign "Hash:" header is missing or does not match the
	actual sig.

	* keyedit.c (menu_revsig): Properly show a uid is revoked without
	restarting gpg.  This is Debian bug 124219, though their supplied
	patch will not do the right thing.

	* main.h, tdbio.c (tdbio_set_dbname), misc.c (removed
	check_permissions), keydb.c (keydb_add_resource), g10.c (main,
	check_permissions): Significant reworking of the permission check
	mechanism.  The new behavior is to check everything in the homedir
	by checking the homedir itself.  If the user wants to put
	(possibly shared) keyrings outside the homedir, they are not
	checked.  The options file and any extension files are checked
	wherever they are, as well as their enclosing directories.  This
	is Debian bug 147760.

2002-08-06  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* g10.c (main): Use of EXTSEP_S in new gpg.conf string.
	* openfile.c (copy_options_file): Ditto.

2002-08-06  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main), mainproc.c (proc_encrypted):
	--ignore-mdc-error option to turn a MDC check error into a
	warning.

	* encode.c (encode_crypt), g10.c (main), sign.c (sign_file,
	clearsign_file): Use the same --pgpX warning string everywhere to
	ease translations.

	* encode.c (write_pubkey_enc_from_list): Warn when using
	--throw-keyid with --pgpX.  Noted by Vedaal Nistar.

	* revoke.c (export_minimal_pk, gen_desig_revoke, gen_revoke):
	Export a minimal pk along with the revocation cert when in --pgpX
	mode so that PGP can import it.

2002-08-06  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* options.skel: Changed comments.

	* g10.c (main): Try to use "gpg.conf" as default option file.
	* openfile.c (copy_options_file): Changed name of created file.

2002-08-02  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* Makefile.am (LDFLAGS): Removed DYNLINK_LDFLAGS.

2002-07-30  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main), mainproc.c (proc_encrypted): Return a
	decryption failed error if a MDC does not verify.  Warn if a MDC
	is not present (can disable via --no-mdc-warning).

	* exec.c (exec_write), g10.c (main), keyserver.c
	(keyserver_spawn): Use new DISABLE_KEYSERVER_PATH rather than
	FIXED_EXEC_PATH.

2002-07-28  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* sig-check.c (do_check): Properly validate v4 sigs with no hashed
	section at all.

2002-07-25  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* delkey.c (do_delete_key): Always allow to delete a key in batch mode
	when specified by fingerprint.  Suggested by Enzo Michelangeli.

2002-07-25  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (menu_revsig): Change "revsig" to honor selected uids
	so the user can revoke sigs from particular uids only.

	* keylist.c (list_keyblock_print): Don't display expired uids in
	--list-keys unless -v and not --list-sigs (just like revoked
	uids).

	* exec.c, export.c, import.c, keyedit.c, keyserver.c, misc.c:
	"Warning" -> "WARNING"

2002-07-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* main.h, import.c (parse_import_options, fix_hkp_corruption,
	import_one, delete_inv_parts), g10.c (main): New import-option
	"repair-hkp-subkey-bug", which repairs as much as possible the HKP
	mangling multiple subkeys bug.  It is on by default for keyserver
	receives, and off by default for regular --import.

	* main.h, import.c (import, import_one, delete_inv_parts), hkp.c
	(hkp_ask_import), keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Use keyserver
	import options when doing keyserver receives.

	* options.h, exec.h, exec.c (set_exec_path, exec_write), g10.c
	(main), keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): If the user does not use
	"exec-path", completely replace $PATH with GNUPG_LIBEXECDIR before
	calling the keyserver helper.  If the user does use "exec-path",
	append GNUPG_LIBEXECDIR after the specified path.

2002-07-23  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* import.c (parse_import_options), export.c
	(parse_export_options): Fix offset problem with reversed ("no-")
	meanings.

	* import.c (delete_inv_parts): Discard subkey signatures (0x18 and
	0x28) if found in the userid section of the key.

	* sig-check.c (signature_check2): Signatures made by invalid
	subkeys (bad/missing binding sig) are also invalid.

	* keylist.c (print_fingerprint): Show the primary as well as the
	secondary key fingerprint in modes 1 & 2.

2002-07-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, main.h, g10.c (main), import.c
	(parse_import_options, delete_inv_parts), keyserver.c
	(parse_keyserver_options): add new --import-options option.  The
	only current flag is "allow-local-sigs".

	* g10.c (main): Don't disable MDC in pgp7 mode.

	* options.h, g10.c (main), keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_options):
	Remove old keyserver-option include-attributes now that there is
	an export-option for the same thing.

	* options.h, main.h, export.c (parse_export_options,
	do_export_stream), g10.c (main): add new --export-options option.
	Current flags are "include-non-rfc", "include-local-sigs",
	"include-attributes", and "include-sensitive-revkeys".

	* options.h, hkp.c (hkp_export), keyserver.c
	(parse_keyserver_options, keyserver_spawn): try passing unknown
	keyserver options to export options, and if successful, use them
	when doing a keyserver --send-key.

	* build-packet.c (build_sig_subpkt): We do not generate
	SIGSUBPKT_PRIV_VERIFY_CACHE anymore.

	* revoke.c (gen_desig_revoke): Lots more comments about including
	sensitive revkeys along with the revocation sig itself.

	* keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_options): Simpler implementation
	that can skip one pass over the options.

2002-07-18  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu, menu_addrevoker): Allow specifying
	"sensitive" as an argument to an addrevoker command.  This sets
	the 0x40 sensitive revoker flag.

	* revoke.c (gen_desig_revoke): When generating a designated
	revocation, include the direct key sig that contains the
	designated revoker subpacket.  This allows sensitive designated
	revocation subpackets to be exported.  Also indicate which
	revokers are sensitive in the first place.

2002-07-17  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names_colon): The 0x40 class bit in
	a designated revoker means "sensitive", not "local".  It's
	exportable under the right circumstances.

	* main.h, options.h, export.c (do_export_stream), g10.c (main),
	hkp.c (hkp_export), keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn: Add a flag to
	skip attribute packets and their signatures while exporting.  This
	is to accomodate keyservers (pksd again) that choke on attributes.
	Use keyserver-option "include-attributes" to control it.  This
	defaults to ON (i.e. don't skip).

2002-07-09  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_uri, keyserver_spawn,
	keyserver_work), hkp.c (hkp_ask_import, hkp_export, hkp_search):
	Use a much more strict reading of RFC-2396 for the keyserver URIs.
	Specifically, don't try and be smart about checking the value of
	":port" so long as it is all digits, and properly handle opaque
	data (those scheme specific parts that do not start with "//").

2002-07-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* photoid.c (get_default_photo_command, show_photos): Honor
	FIXED_PHOTO_VIEWER and DISABLE_PHOTO_VIEWER.

	* mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print): Use --show-photos to show
	photos when verifying a sig made by a key with a photo.

	* keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_uri): Properly parse a URI with no
	:port section and an empty file path, but with a terminating '/'.
	(keyserver_work): Honor DISABLE_KEYSERVER_HELPERS.

	* hkp.c (hkp_ask_import): Display keyserver URI as a URI, but only
	if verbose.

	* exec.c, g10.c: USE_EXEC_PATH -> FIXED_EXEC_PATH

2002-07-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* exec.h, exec.c (set_exec_path, exec_write), g10.c (main): If
	USE_EXEC_PATH is defined at compile time, use it to lock the
	exec-path and not allow the user to change it.

2002-07-02  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main), keyserver.c (keyserver_refresh):
	Maintain and use the original keyserver URI for cosmetics rather
	than trying to recreate it when needed.

	* mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print): Properly disregard expired
	uids.  Make sure that the first uid listed is a real uid and not
	an attribute (attributes should only be listed in the "aka"
	section).  When there are no valid textual userids, try for an
	invalid textual userid before using any attribute uid.

2002-07-01  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.skel: Fix a few typos, clarify "group", and remove
	sample photo viewers for Win32 since they are the defaults now.

	* parse-packet.c (make_attribute_uidname), keylist.c
	(dump_attribs): Fix two typecast warnings.

	* packet.h, build-packet.c (build_attribute_subpkt), exec.c
	(expand_args), mkdtemp.c (mkdtemp), photoid.c
	(parse_image_header): Fix some signedness compiler warnings.

2002-07-01  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* photoid.c (get_default_photo_command): Also use __MINGW32__
	instead of HAVE_DOSISH_SYSTEM.

	* encode.c (encode_symmetric): Do not use the new encryption code.

2002-06-30  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* photoid.c: Use __MINGW32__ to include windows because
	HAVE_DOSISH_SYSTEM is also set for OS/2 and plain DOS.  Provide
	constant missing in older mingw installations.

2002-06-21  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* g10.c [__riscos__]: Moved RISC OS specific stuff to util/riscos.c
	and include/util.h.

	* gpgv.c [__riscos__]: Likewise.

2002-06-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keydb.h, pkclist.c (select_algo_from_prefs): Allow passing a
	suggested algorithm which will be used if available.

	* encode.c (encode_crypt, encrypt_filter), sign.c (sign_file): Use
	new select_algo_from_prefs feature to check if forcing an
	algorithm would violate the recipient preferences.

	* photoid.c (get_default_photo_command, show_photos): Use
	different default viewers on different platforms.  Currently we
	have Win 9x, Win NT (2k, xp), Mac OSX, RISC OS, and "everybody
	else".  These are #ifdefs as much as possible to avoid clutter.

	* g10.c (strusage, build_list), keyedit.c (show_prefs), main.h,
	misc.c (compress_algo_to_string, check_compress_algo), pkclist.c
	(algo_available), keygen.c (keygen_set_std_prefs): New
	algo_to_string and check functions for compress algorithms.

2002-06-20  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* misc.c (setsysinfo): Removed a #warning for Alpha's uniligedn
	trap disabling - it is quite possible that this is a debug relict.

2002-06-20  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* g10.c [__riscos__]: Added image file system feature.

	* gpgv.c [__riscos__]: Added image file system feature.

	* photoid.c (show_photos) [__riscos__]: Set RISC OS filetype of
	photo id according to MIME type.

2002-06-19  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* hkp.c (parse_hkp_index): Don't leak memory when failing out of a
	bad HKP keyserver.

	* g10.c (add_notation_data): Relax slightly the rules as to what
	can go into a notation name - 2440 allows "@", for example.

2002-06-17  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* import.c (clean_subkeys, import_one): Only allow at most 1
	binding sig and at most 1 revocation sig on a subkey, as per
	2440:11.1.

	* hkp.c (parse_hkp_index, hkp_search): Error if the keyserver
	returns an unparseable HKP response.

2002-06-15  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names), keylist.c
	(list_keyblock_print): Show "[expired]" before expired uids.

	* keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names_colon), mainproc.c
	(list_node), keylist.c (list_keyblock_colon): Show flag 'e' for
	expired user ids.  Use "uat" for user attribute packets instead of
	"uid".  Also use '<count> <length>' rather than the fake user id
	string on attributes.

	* keygen.c (keygen_add_revkey): Remove unused code.

	* misc.c (check_permissions): Check directory permissions
	properly - they are not special files.

	* pkclist.c (expand_id, expand_group, build_pk_list): When
	expanding groups before building a pk list, inherit flags from the
	original pre-expanded string.

	* pubkey-enc.c (is_algo_in_prefs): Don't use prefs from expired
	uids.

2002-06-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* free-packet.c (copy_signature): Properly copy a signature that
	carries a revocation key on it.

	* pkclist.c (expand_id, expand_group, build_pk_list): Groups now
	work properly when used in the "Enter the user ID" prompt.

2002-06-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names): Display warning if a user
	tries to show prefs on a v3 key with a v3 selfsig.

	* kbnode.c (dump_kbnode): Show if a uid is expired.

	* import.c (merge_blocks, import_revoke_cert): Show user ID
	receiving a revocation certificate.

	* free-packet.c (cmp_user_ids): Properly compare attribute ids.

	* pkclist.c (expand_groups): Maintain the strlist flags while
	expanding.  Members of an expansion inherit their flags from the
	expansion key.

	* options.h, cipher.c (write_header), g10.c (main), keygen.c
	(keygen_set_std_prefs): remove the personal_mdc flag.  It no
	longer serves a purpose now that the personal preference lists are
	split into cipher/digest/zip.

2002-06-14  Timo Schulz  <ts@winpt.org>

	* skclist.c (is_insecure): Implemented.

2002-06-12  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Properly handle PROGRAM responses
	when they have a CRLF ending.  Noted by Keith Ray.

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Handle CRLF endings from
	keyserver helpers.  Also don't leak the last line worth of memory
	from the keyserver response.

	* main.h, misc.c (deprecated_warning): New function to warn about
	deprecated options and commands.

	* g10.c (main), keyserver-internal.h, keyserver.c
	(parse_keyserver_uri): Use new deprecated function to warn about
	honor-http-proxy, auto-key-retrieve, and x-broken-hkp.

2002-06-11  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am: link gpg with NETLIBS for the built-in HKP access.

2002-06-10  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, keyserver.c (keyserver_opts), g10.c (main): New
	keyserver option "include-subkeys".  This feature already existed,
	but now can be turned off.  It defaults to on.

	* options.h, keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_options,
	keyserver_spawn): There are now enough options to justify making a
	structure for the keyserver options rather than a page of
	if-then-else-if-then-etc.

	* getkey.c (merge_keys_and_selfsig, merge_selfsigs_main): Fix bug
	in calculating key expiration dates.

2002-06-09  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keydb.h, getkey.c (get_user_id_native), import.c (import_one):
	Display user ID while importing a key.  Note this applies to both
	--import and keyserver --recv-keys.

	* exec.c (exec_finish): Log unnatural exit (core dump, killed
	manually, etc) for fork/exec/pipe child processes.

2002-06-08  Timo Schulz  <ts@winpt.org>

	* encode.c (encode_symmetric): Disable the compat flag
	when the expert mode is enabled.

2002-06-07  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.skel, options.h, main.h, keydb.h, pkclist.c
	(build_pk_list, expand_groups), g10.c (main, add_group): Add new
	"group" command to allow one name to expand into multiple keys.
	For simplicity, and to avoid potential loops, we only expand once
	- you can't make an alias that points to an alias.

	* main.h, g10.c (main), keygen.c (build_personal_digest_list):
	Simplify the default digest list - there is really no need for the
	other hashes since they will never be used after SHA-1 in the
	list.

	* options.skel, options.h, g10.c (main), hkp.c (hkp_ask_import,
	hkp_export, hkp_search), keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_options,
	parse_keyserver_uri, keyserver_work, keyserver_refresh): Make the
	"x-broken-hkp" keyserver scheme into keyserver-option
	"broken-http-proxy".  Move honor_http_proxy into
	keyserver_options.  Canonicalize the three variations of "hkp",
	"x-hkp", and "x-broken-hkp" into "hkp".

2002-06-07  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* g10.c [__riscos__]: Added --attribute-file to do the same as
	--attribute-fd, but with a filename not a fd as argument.
	Added magic symbol for RISC OS to use different memory management.

	* gpgv.c [__riscos__]: Added magic symbol for RISC OS to use
	different memory management.

2002-06-06  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* main.h, g10.c (main), keygen.c (build_personal_digest_list): Put
	in a default digest preference list consisting of SHA-1, followed
	by every other installed digest except MD5.  Note this is the same
	as having no digest preference at all except for SHA-1 being
	favored.

	* options.h, g10.c (main), keygen.c (keygen_set_std_prefs),
	pkclist.c (select_algo_from_prefs): Split
	--personal-preference-list into three:
	--personal-{cipher|digest|compress}-preferences.  This allows a
	user to set one without affecting another (i.e. setting only a
	digest pref doesn't imply an empty cipher pref).

	* exec.c (exec_read): This is a safer way of guessing the return
	value of system().  Noted by Stefan Bellon.

2002-06-05  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* hkp.c (parse_hkp_index): Be more robust with keyservers
	returning very unparseable responses.

	* exec.c (exec_read): Catch and display an error when the remote
	process exits unnaturally (i.e. segfault) so the user knows what
	happened.  Also fix exec_write stub which has a different number
	of arguments now.

2002-06-05  Timo Schulz  <ts@winpt.org>

	* encode.c (encode_simple): Ignore the new mode for RFC1991.
	* mainproc.c (symkey_decrypt_sesskey): Better check for weird
	keysizes.

2002-06-05  Timo Schulz  <ts@winpt.org>

	* encode.c (encode_sesskey): New.
	(encode_simple): Use it here. But by default we use the compat
	mode which supress to generate encrypted session keys.

2002-06-05  Timo Schulz  <ts@winpt.org>

	* mainproc.c (symkey_decrypt_sesskey): New.
	(proc_symkey_enc): Support for encrypted session keys.

2002-06-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* sign.c (hash_for, sign_file): When encrypting and signing at the
	same time, consult the various hash prefs to pick a hash algorithm
	to use.  Pass in a 160-bit hint if any of the signing keys are
	DSA.

	* keydb.h, pkclist.c (select_algo_from_prefs, algo_available):
	Pass a "hints" opaque pointer in to let the caller give hints as
	to what algorithms would be acceptable.  The only current hint is
	for PREFTYPE_HASH to require a 160-bit hash for DSA.  Change all
	callers in encode.c (encode_crypt, encrypt_filter) and sign.c
	(sign_file).  If we settle on MD5 as the best algorithm based
	solely on recepient keys and SHA1 is also a possibility, use SHA1
	unless the user intentionally chose MD5.  This is as per 2440:13.

	* exec.c (make_tempdir): Fix duplicated filename problem.

2002-06-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* packet.h, parse-packet.c (enum_sig_subpkt): Report back from
	enum_sig_subpkt when a subpacket is critical and change all
	callers in keylist.c (show_policy_url, show_notation), mainproc.c
	(print_notation_data), and pkclist.c (do_show_revocation_reason).

	* keylist.c (show_policy_url, show_notation): Display if the
	policy or notation is critical.

2002-06-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* main.h, g10.c (main), keylist.c (dump_attribs, set_attrib_fd,
	list_keyblock_print, list_keyblock_colon), status.h, status.c
	(get_status_string): New --attribute-fd feature to dump the
	contents of attribute subpackets for frontends.  If --status-fd is
	also used, then a new status tag ATTRIBUTE is provided for each
	subpacket.

	* packet.h, getkey.c (fixup_uidnode, merge_selfsigs_main,
	merge_selfsigs_subkey), parse-packet.c (setup_user_id): Keep track
	of the expiration time of a user ID, and while we're at it, use
	the expired flag from the selfsig rather than reparsing the
	SIG_EXPIRE subpacket.

	* photoid.c (generate_photo_id): When adding a new photo ID,
	showing the photo for confirmation is not safe when noninteractive
	since the "user" may not be able to dismiss a viewer window.
	Noted by Timo Schulz.

2002-06-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.skel: Sample photo viewers for Win32.

	* misc.c (pct_expando): Use the seckey for %k/%K if the pubkey is
	not available.

	* photoid.h, photoid.c (show_photos): Include the seckey in case a
	user tries to view a photo on a secret key, and change all callers
	in keyedit.c (menu_showphoto), keylist.c (list_keyblock_print),
	and photoid.c (generate_photo_id).

2002-06-02  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* photoid.c (show_photos): Work properly when not called with a
	public key.

2002-05-31  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* sign.c (mk_notation_and_policy): Free unneeded buffer.

	* hkp.c (parse_hkp_index): Properly handle the '&' character
	(i.e. "&amp;") in HKP responses.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main): Fix reversed expiration time
	check with self-sigs.

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids): When making a new self-sig on a v3 key,
	make a v3 self-sig unless it is currently a v3 self-sig being
	promoted to v4.

2002-05-31  Timo Schulz  <ts@winpt.org>

	* pkclist.c (do_show_revocation_reason): Don't use capital
	letters for non-interactive output.
	(show_revocation_reason): Now it is global.
	* pubkey-enc.c (get_it): Show if the key has been revoked.

2002-05-30  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* sign.c (write_signature_packets, sign_file, clearsign_file,
	sign_symencrypt_file): Make a v4 signature if a policy URL or
	notation is set, unless v3 sigs are forced via rfc1991 or
	force-v3-sigs.  Also remove some doubled code and clarify an error
	message (we don't sign in PGP2 mode - just detach-sign).

	* parse-packet.c (parse_one_sig_subpkt): Add KS_FLAGS to the "any
	size" section.

2002-05-29  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (keygen_set_std_prefs, add_feature_mdc): Use "mdc" and
	"no-mdc" in the prefs string to allow switching on and off the MDC
	feature.  This is needed to properly export a key from GnuPG for
	use on PGP which does not support MDC - without this, MDC-capable
	implementations will still try and generate MDCs which will break
	PGP.

	* keygen.c (keygen_get_std_prefs): Show "[mdc]" in prefs string if
	it is enabled.

	* options.h, g10.c (main), cipher.c (write_header), keygen.c
	(keygen_set_std_prefs): For consistency, allow the user to specify
	mdc/no-mdc in the --personal-preference-list.  If disabled, it
	acts just like --disable-mdc.

2002-05-29  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, exec.c: Add some debugging info, using the 1024 debug
	flag.

	* exec.c (win_system): New system()-like function for win32 that
	does not return until the child process terminates.  Of course,
	this doesn't help if the process itself exits before it is
	finished.

2002-05-29  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* encode.c (encode_simple): Intialize PKT when --no-literal is used.

	* keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names_colon): Renamed the record
	for revocation keys to "rvk".

2002-05-27  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names_colon): New.
	(show_key_with_all_names): Divert to new function when required.
	Sanitize printing of revoker name.

2002-05-27  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* build-packet.c (build_sig_subpkt): Handle setting sig flags for
	certain subpacket types (notation, policy url, exportable,
	revocable).  keyedit.c (sign_mk_attrib): Flags no longer need to
	be set here.

	* packet.h, parse-packet.c (parse_one_sig_subpkt), build-packet.c
	(build_sig_subpkt): Call parse_one_sig_subpkt to sanity check
	buffer lengths before building a sig subpacket.

2002-05-26  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* sign.c (mk_notation_and_policy): Include secret key to enable %s
	expandos, and pass notations through pct_expando as well.

	* main.h, misc.c (pct_expando): Add %s and %S expandos for
	signer's keyid.

2002-05-25  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (strusage, build_list): Add compress algorithms to
	--version list.  Show algorithm numbers when --verbose --version
	is done.

2002-05-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, main.h, keygen.c (keygen_set_set_prefs,
	keygen_get_std_prefs, keygen_upd_std_prefs), keyedit.c
	(keyedit_menu), g10.c (main), pkclist.c (select_algo_from_prefs):
	Add --personal-preference-list which allows the user to factor in
	their own preferred algorithms when the preference lists are
	consulted.  Obviously, this does not let the user violate a
	recepient's preferences (and the RFC) - this only influences the
	ranking of the agreed-on (and available) algorithms from the
	recepients.  Suggested by David Hollenberg.

	* options.h, keygen.c (keygen_set_std_prefs), g10.c (main): Rename
	--preference-list to --default-preference-list (as that is what it
	really is), and make it a true default in that if the user selects
	"default" they get this list and not the compiled-in list.

2002-05-22  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* g10.c (main): Add missing LF in a info printout and made it
	translatable.  Noted by Michael Tokarev.

2002-05-21  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* g10.c (main): Removed the undef of USE_SHM_COPROCESSING which
	was erroneously introduced on 2002-01-09.

	* signal.c (got_fatal_signal): Don't write the Nul to stderr.
	Reported by David Hollenberg.

2002-05-18  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* main.h, g10.c (main), revoke.c (gen_desig_revoke): Generate a
	designated revocation via --desig-revoke

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu, menu_addrevoker): New "addrevoker"
	command to add a designated revoker to a key.

2002-05-17  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* gpgv.c: Add stub for get_ownertrust().

	* g10.c (main): --allow-freeform-uid should be implied by
	OpenPGP.  Add --no-allow-freeform-uid.

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids): Issue a warning when signing a
	non-selfsigned uid.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main): If a key has no selfsigs, and
	allow-non-selfsigned-uid is not set, still try and make the key
	valid by checking all uids for a signature from an ultimately
	trusted key.

2002-05-16  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* main.h, keygen.c (keygen_add_revkey): Add revocation key
	subpackets to a signature (callable by
	make_keysig_packet). (write_direct_sig): Write a 1F direct key
	signature. (parse_revocation_key): Parse a string in
	algo:fpr:sensitive format into a revocation
	key. (get_parameter_revkey, do_generate_keypair): Call above
	functions when prompted from a batch key generation file.

	* build-packet.c (build_sig_subpkt): Allow multiple revocation key
	subpackets in a single sig.

	* keydb.h, getkey.c (get_seckey_byfprint): Same as
	get_pubkey_byfprint, except for secret keys.  We only know the
	fingerprint of a revocation key, so this is needed to retrieve the
	secret key needed to issue a revokation.

	* packet.h, parse-packet.c (parse_signature, parse_revkeys): Split
	revkey parsing off into a new function that can be used to reparse
	after manipulating the revkey list.

	* sign.c (make_keysig_packet): Ability to make 1F direct key
	signatures.

2002-05-15  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.skel: keyserver.pgp.com is gone, so list pgp.surfnet.nl
	as a sample LDAP server instead.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main): Properly handle multiple
	revocation keys in a single packet.  Properly handle revocation
	keys that are in out-of-order packets.  Remove duplicates in
	revocation key list.

2002-05-14  Timo Schulz   <ts@winpt.org>

	* exec.c (make_tempdir) [MINGW32]: Added missing '\'.

2002-05-14  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* exec.c (make_tempdir): Make use of EXTSEP_S instead of hardcoded
	dot as extension separator.

2002-05-13  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* photoid.c (show_photos): Use the long keyid as the filename for
	the photo.  Use the short keyid as the filename on 8.3 systems.

	* exec.h, exec.c (make_tempdir, exec_write, exec_finish): Allow
	caller to specify filename.  This should make things easier on
	windows and macs where the file extension is required, but a whole
	filename is even better.

	* keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names, show_prefs): Show proper
	prefs for a v4 key uid with no selfsig at all.

	* misc.c (check_permissions): Don't check permissions on
	non-normal files (pipes, character devices, etc.)

2002-05-11  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* mainproc.c (proc_symkey_enc): Avoid segv in case the parser
	encountered an invalid packet.

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_export): Get confirmation before sending
	all keys.

2002-05-10  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* g10.c, hkp.c, keyedit.c, keyserver.c: Replaced all occurrances
	of strcasecmp with ascii_strcasecmp and all occurrances of
	strncasecmp with ascii_memcasecmp.

2002-05-10  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* packet.h, getkey.c (fixup_uidnode), keyedit.c (show_prefs): Show
	assumed prefs for hash and compression as well as the cipher pref.
	Show assumed prefs if there are no prefs at all on a v4
	self-signed key.

	* options.h, g10.c (main), sign.c (make_keysig_packet): New
	--cert-digest-algo function to override the default key signing
	hash algorithm.

2002-05-09  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main): Make sure the revocation key
	list starts clean as this function may be called more than once
	(e.g. from functions in --edit).

	* g10.c, encode.c (encode_crypt), sign.c (sign_file,
	sign_symencrypt_file): Make --compress-algo work like the
	documentation says.  It should be like --cipher-algo and
	--digest-algo in that it can override the preferences calculation
	and impose the setting the user wants.  No --compress-algo setting
	allows the usual preferences calculation to take place.

	* main.h, compress.c (compress_filter): use new
	DEFAULT_COMPRESS_ALGO define, and add a sanity check for compress
	algo value.

2002-05-08  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* pkclist.c (select_algo_from_prefs): There is an assumed
	compression preference for uncompressed data.

2002-05-07  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main), getkey.c (finish_lookup), pkclist.c
	(algo_available): --pgp7, identical to --pgp6 except that it
	permits a few algorithms that PGP 7 added: AES128, AES192, AES256,
	and TWOFISH.  Any more of these --pgpX flags, and it'll be time to
	start looking at a generic --emulate-pgp X option.

	* export.c (do_export_stream): Warn the user when exporting a
	secret key if it or any of its secret subkeys are protected with
	SHA1 while simple_sk_checksum is set.

	* parse-packet.c (parse_key): Show when the SHA1 protection is
	used in --list-packets.

	* options.h, build-packet.c (do_comment), g10.c (main): Rename
	--no-comment as --sk-comments/--no-sk-comments (--no-comment still
	works) and make the default be --no-sk-comments.

2002-05-07  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* keygen.c (get_parameter_algo): Never allow generation of the
	deprecated RSA-E or RSA-S flavors of PGP RSA.
	(ask_algo): Allow generation of RSA sign and encrypt in expert
	mode.  Don't allow ElGamal S+E unless in expert mode.
	* helptext.c: Added entry keygen.algo.rsa_se.

2002-05-07  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids): If --expert is set, allow re-signing a
	uid to promote a v3 self-sig to a v4 one.  This essentially
	deletes the old v3 self-sig and replaces it with a v4 one.

	* packet.h, parse-packet.c (parse_key), getkey.c
	(merge_keys_and_selfsig, merge_selfsigs_main): a v3 key with a v4
	self-sig must never let the v4 self-sig express a key expiration
	time that extends beyond the original v3 expiration time.

2002-05-06  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids): When making a self-signature via "sign"
	don't ask about sig level or expiration, and include the usual
	preferences and such for v4 self-sigs.  (menu_set_preferences):
	Convert uids from UTF8 to native before printing.

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids): Convert uids from UTF8 to native before
	printing.  (menu_set_primary_uid): Show error if the user tries to
	make a uid with a v3 self-sig primary.

2002-05-05  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* import.c (import_one): When merging with a key we already have,
	don't let a key conflict (same keyid but different key) stop the
	import: just skip the bad key and continue.

	* exec.c (make_tempdir): Under Win32, don't try environment
	variables for temp directories - GetTempDir tries environment
	variables internally, and it's better not to second-guess it in
	case MS adds some sort of temp dir handling to Windows at some
	point.

2002-05-05  Timo Schulz  <ts@winpt.org>

	* mainproc.c (proc_symkey_enc): Don't ask for a passphrase
        in the list only mode.

2002-05-05  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_refresh): --refresh-keys implies
	--merge-only so as not to import keys with keyids that match the
	ones being refreshed.  Noted by Florian Weimer.

2002-05-04  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* free-packet.c (copy_public_key): Don't call m_alloc(0), therefore
	added consistency check for revkey and numrefkeys.

	* getkey.c (check_revocation_keys): Added consistency check for
	revkey and numrefkeys.

	* keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names): Likewise.

2002-05-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* photoid.c: Provide default image viewer for Win32.

	* misc.c (pct_expando): %t means extension, not name ("jpg", not
	"jpeg").

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn), photoid.c (show_photos), exec.h,
	exec.c: Allow the caller to determine the temp file extension when
	starting an exec_write and change all callers.

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids): Nonrevocable key signatures cause an
	automatic promotion to v4.

	* exec.c: Provide stubs for exec_ functions when NO_EXEC is
	defined.

2002-05-02  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* photoid.h, photoid.c (parse_image_header, image_type_to_string):
	Useful functions to return data about an image.

	* packet.h, parse-packet.c (make_attribute_uidname,
	parse_attribute_subpkts, parse_attribute), photoid.h, photoid.c
	(show_photos): Handle multiple images in a single attribute
	packet.

	* main.h, misc.c (pct_expando), sign.c (mk_notation_and_policy),
	photoid.c (show_photos): Simpler expando code that does not
	require using compile-time string sizes.  Call
	image_type_to_string to get image strings (i.e. "jpg",
	"image/jpeg").  Change all callers.

	* keyedit.c (menu_showphoto), keylist.c (list_keyblock_print):
	Allow viewing multiple images within a single attribute packet.

	* gpgv.c: Various stubs for link happiness.

2002-05-02  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* build-packet.c (build_sig_subpkt), keyedit.c (sign_uids),
	options.h, sign.c (mk_notation_and_policy), g10.c (main,
	add_notation_data, add_policy_url (new), check_policy_url
	(removed)): Allow multiple policy URLs on a given signature.
	Split "--notation-data" into "--cert-notation" and
	"--sig-notation" so the user can set different policies for key
	and data signing.  For backwards compatibility, "--notation-data"
	sets both, as before.

2002-05-02  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* options.skel: Removed the comment on trusted-keys because this
	option is now deprecated.

2002-05-01  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (menu_adduid): 2440bis04 says that multiple attribute
	packets on a given key are legal.

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_refresh): the fake v3 keyid hack applies
	to "mailto" URLs as well since they are also served by pksd.

2002-04-29  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	Added a copyright year for files changed this year.

2002-04-25  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* g10.c, options.h: New options --display, --ttyname, --ttytype,
	--lc-ctype, --lc-messages to be used with future versions of the
	gpg-agent.
	* passphrase.c (agent_send_option,agent_send_all_options): New.
	(agent_open): Send options to the agent.

	* trustdb.c (update_ownertrust, clear_ownertrust): Do an explicit
	do_sync because revalidation_mark does it only if when the
	timestamp actually changes.

2002-04-23  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* main.h, keygen.c (do_generate_keypair), keylist.c
	(print_signature_stats, list_all, list_one, list_keyblock,
	list_keyblock_print, list_keyblock_colon): After generating a new
	key, show the key information (name, keyid, fingerprint, etc.)
	Also do not print uncheckable signatures (missing key..) in
	--check-sigs.  Print statistics (N missing keys, etc.) after
	--check-sigs.

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids): When signing a key with an expiration
	date on it, the "Do you want your signature to expire at the same
	time?" question should default to YES.

2002-04-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* parse-packet.c (parse_plaintext), packet.h, plaintext.c
	(handle_plaintext): Fix bug in handling literal packets with
	zero-length data (no data was being confused with partial body
	length).

	* misc.c (pct_expando), options.skel: %t means extension ("jpg").
	%T means MIME type ("image/jpeg").

	* import.c (import_one): Only trigger trust update if the keyring
	is actually changed.

	* export.c (do_export_stream): Missing a m_free.

2002-04-22  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* keyid.c (expirestr_from_sk, expirestr_from_sig): Added _() to
	string constant.

	* exec.c (make_tempdir) [__riscos__]: Better placement of
	temporary file.

2002-04-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (generate_subkeypair): 2440bis04 adds that creating
	subkeys on v3 keys is a MUST NOT.

	* getkey.c (finish_lookup): The --pgp6 "use the primary key"
	behavior should only apply while data signing and not encryption.
	Noted by Roger Sondermann.

2002-04-19  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* keygen.c (keygen_set_std_prefs): Put back 3DES because the RFC
	says it is good form to do so.

2002-04-19  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (menu_deluid): Only cause a trust update if we delete
	a non-revoked user id.

	* hkp.c (hkp_ask_import), keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_options,
	keyserver_spawn), options.h: Remove fast-import keyserver option
	(no longer meaningful).

	* g10.c (main), keyedit.c (sign_uids), options.h: Change
	--default-check-level to --default-cert-check-level as it makes
	clear what it operates on.

	* g10.c (main): --pgp6 also implies --no-ask-sig-expire.

	* delkey.c (do_delete_key): Comment.

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids, keyedit_menu, menu_deluid, menu_delsig,
	menu_expire, menu_revsig, menu_revkey): Only force a trustdb check
	if we did something that changes it.

	* g10.c: add "--auto-check-trustdb" to override a
	"--no-auto-check-trustdb"

2002-04-19  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* tdbio.c (tdbio_write_nextcheck): Return a status whether the
	stamp was actually changed.
	* trustdb.c (revalidation_mark): Sync the changes.  Removed the
	sync operation done by its callers.
	(get_validity): Add logic for maintaining a pending_check flag.
	(clear_ownertrust): New.

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids): Don't call revalidation_mark depending on
	primary_pk.
	(keyedit_menu): Call revalidation_mark after "trust".
	(show_key_with_all_names): Print a warning on the wrong listed key
	validity.

	* delkey.c (do_delete_key): Clear the owenertrust information when
	deleting a public key.

2002-04-18  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* seskey.c (encode_md_value): Print an error message if a wrong
	digest algorithm is used with DSA.  Changed all callers to cope
	with a NULL return.  Problem noted by Imad R. Faiad.

2002-04-18  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* trustdb.c (mark_usable_uid_certs): Properly handle nonrevocable
	signatures that can expire.  In short, the only thing that can
	override an unexpired nonrevocable signature is another unexpired
	nonrevocable signature.

	* getkey.c (finish_lookup): Always use primary signing key for
	signatures when --pgp6 is on since pgp6 and 7 do not understand
	signatures made by signing subkeys.

2002-04-18  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* trustdb.c (validate_keys): Never schedule a nextcheck into the
	past.
	(validate_key_list): New arg curtime use it to set next_expire.
	(validate_one_keyblock): Take the current time from the caller.
	(clear_validity, reset_unconnected_keys): New.
	(validate_keys): Reset all unconnected keys.

	* getkey.c (premerge_public_with_secret): Fixed 0x12345678! syntax
	for use with secret keys.
	(lookup): Advance the searchmode after a search FIRST.

	* seckey-cert.c (do_check): Always calculate the old checksum for
	use after unprotection.

	* g10.c, options.skel: New option --no-escape-from.  Made
	--escape-from and --force-v3-sigs the default and removed them
	from the options skeleton.

2002-04-16  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* parse-packet.c (parse_key): Support a SHA1 checksum as per
	draft-rfc2440-bis04.
	* packet.h (PKT_secret_key): Add field sha1chk.
	* seckey-cert.c (do_check): Check the SHA1 checksum
	(protect_secret_key): And create it.
	* build-packet.c (do_secret_key): Mark it as sha-1 protected.
	* g10.c, options.h: New option --simple-sk-checksum.

2002-04-13  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* parse-packet.c (parse_signature): Minor fix - signatures should
	expire at their expiration time and not one second later.

	* keygen.c (proc_parameter_file): Allow specifying preferences
	string (i.e. "s5 s2 z1 z2", etc) in a batchmode key generation
	file.

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu): Print standard error message when
	signing a revoked key (no new translation).

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs): Get the default set of key prefs from
	the real (not attribute) primary uid.

2002-04-12  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* pkclist.c (build_pk_list): Fix bug that allowed a key to be
	selected twice in batch mode if one instance was the default
	recipient and the other was an encrypt-to.  Noted by Stefan
	Bellon.

	* parse-packet.c (dump_sig_subpkt): Show data in trust and regexp
	sig subpackets.

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu): Use new function real_uids_left to
	prevent deleting the last real (i.e. non-attribute) uid.  Again,
	according to the attribute draft. (menu_showphoto): Make another
	string translatable.

2002-04-11  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* build-packet.c (build_sig_subpkt): Delete subpackets from both
	hashed and unhashed area on update.  (find_subpkt): No longer
	needed.

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids): With --pgp2 on, refuse to sign a v3 key
	with a v4 signature.  As usual, --expert overrides.  Try to tweak
	some strings to a closer match so they can all be translated in
	one place.  Use different helptext keys to allow different help
	text for different questions.

	* keygen.c (keygen_upd_std_prefs): Remove preferences from both
	hashed and unhashed areas if they are not going to be used.

2002-04-10  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* misc.c (pct_expando), options.skel: Use %t to indicate type of a
	photo ID (in this version, it's always "jpeg").  Also tweak string
	expansion loop to minimize reallocs.

	* mainproc.c (do_check_sig): Variable type fix.

	* keyedit.c (menu_set_primary_uid): Differentiate between true
	user IDs and attribute user IDs when making one of them primary.
	That is, if we are making a user ID primary, we alter user IDs.
	If we are making an attribute packet primary, we alter attribute
	packets.  This matches the language in the latest attribute packet
	draft.

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids): No need for the empty string hack.

	* getkey.c (fixup_uidnode): Only accept preferences from the
	hashed segment of the self-sig.

2002-04-10  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* tdbio.c (migrate_from_v2): Fixed the offset to read the old
	ownertrust value and only add entries to the table if we really
	have a value.

2002-04-08  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* status.h, status.c (get_status_string): Add KEYEXPIRED, EXPSIG,
	and EXPKEYSIG.  Add "deprecated-use-keyexpired-instead" to
	SIGEXPIRED.

	* sig-check.c (do_check): Start transition from SIGEXPIRED to
	KEYEXPIRED, since the actual event is signature verification by an
	expired key and not an expired signature. (do_signature_check,
	packet.h): Rename as signature_check2, make public, and change all
	callers.

	* mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print, do_check_sig): Use status
	EXPSIG for an expired, but good, signature.  Add the expiration
	time (or 0) to the VALIDSIG status line.  Use status KEYEXPSIG for
	a good signature from an expired key.

	* g10.c (main): remove checks for no arguments now that argparse
	does it.

2002-04-06  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* keyring.c (keyring_get_keyblock): Disable the keylist mode here.

	* encode.c (encode_simple, encode_crypt): Only test on compressed
	files if a compress level was not explicity set.

	* keygen.c (keygen_set_std_prefs): Removed Blowfish and Twofish
	from the list of default preferences, swapped the preferences of
	RMD160 and SHA1.  Don't include a preference to 3DES unless the
	IDEA kludge gets used.

	* free-packet.c (free_packet): call free_encrypted also for
	PKT_ENCRYPTED_MDC.

	* compress.c (release_context): New.
	(handle_compressed): Allocate the context and setup a closure to
	release the context.  This is required because there is no
	guarabntee that the filter gets popped from the chain at the end
	of the function.  Problem noted by Timo and probably also the
	cause for a couple of other reports.
	(compress_filter): Use the release function if set.

	* tdbio.c [__CYGWIN32__]: Don't rename ftruncate.  Noted by
	Disastry.

	* parse-packet.c (parse_signature): Put parens around a bit test.

	* exec.c (make_tempdir): Double backslash for TMP directory
	creation under Windows.  Better strlen the DIRSEP_S constants for
	allocation measurements.

	* decrypt.c (decrypt_messages): Release the passphrase aquired
	by get_last_passphrase.

2002-04-02  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Removed OPTIONS an pubring.asc - they
	are no longer of any use.

2002-04-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_options): fix auto-key-retrieve to
	actually work as a keyserver-option (noted by Roger Sondermann).

	* keylist.c (reorder_keyblock): do not reorder the primary
	attribute packet - the first user ID must be a genuine one.

2002-03-31  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keylist.c (list_keyblock_colon): Fix ownertrust display with
	--with-colons.

	* keygen.c (generate_user_id), photoid.c (generate_photo_id):
	Properly initialize the user ID refcount.  A few more "y/n" ->
	"y/N" in photoid.c.

	* keyedit.c (ask_revoke_sig): Warn the user if they are about to
	revoke an expired sig (not a problem, but they should know).  Also
	tweak a few prompts to change "y/n" to "y/N", which is how most
	other prompts are written.

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_search_prompt): Control-d escapes the
	keyserver search prompt.

	* pkclist.c (show_revocation_reason & callers): If a subkey is
	considered revoked solely because the parent key is revoked, print
	the revocation reason from the parent key.

	* trustdb.c (get_validity): Allow revocation/expiration to apply
	to a uid/key with no entry in the trustdb.

2002-03-29  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (printunquoted): unquote backslashes from keyserver
	searches

	* hkp.c (write_quoted): quote backslashes from keyserver searches

2002-03-26  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* keygen.c (ask_keysize): Removed the warning for key sizes > 1536.

2002-03-25  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids): Use 2 strings and not a %s so that
	translations can be done the right way.
	* helptext.c: Fixed small typo.

2002-03-23  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* import.c (append_uid, merge_sigs): it is okay to import
	completely non-signed uids now (with --allow-non-selfsigned-uid).

	* getkey.c (get_primary_uid, merge_selfsigs_main): do not choose
	an attribute packet (i.e. photo) as primary uid.  This prevents
	oddities like "Good signature from [image of size 2671]".  This is
	still not perfect (one can still select an attribute packet as
	primary in --edit), but is closer to the way the draft is going.

	* g10.c (build_list): algorithms should include 110.

	* g10.c (main): --pgp2 implies --no-ask-sig-expire and
	--no-ask-cert-expire as those would cause a v4 sig/cert.

	* armor.c (is_armor_header): be more lenient in what constitutes a
	valid armor header (i.e. -----BEGIN blah blah-----) as some
	Windows programs seem to add spaces at the end.  --openpgp makes
	it strict again.

2002-03-18  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_search_prompt): Properly handle a "no
	keys found" case from the internal HKP code (external HKP is ok).
	Also, make a COUNT -1 (i.e. streamed) keyserver response a little
	more efficient.

	* g10.c (main): Add --no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid

2002-03-17  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (main): --openpgp implies --allow-non-selfsigned-uid.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main): If none of the uids are primary
	(because none are valid) then pick the first to be primary (but
	still invalid).  This is for cosmetics in case some display needs
	to print a user ID from a non-selfsigned key.  Also use
	--allow-non-selfsigned-uid to make such a key valid and not
	--always-trust.  The key is *not* automatically trusted via
	--allow-non-selfsigned-uid.

	* mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print): Make sure non-selfsigned uids
	print [uncertain] on verification even though one is primary now.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs): If the main key is not valid, then
	neither are the subkeys.

	* import.c (import_one): Allow --allow-non-selfsigned-uid to work
	on completely unsigned keys.  Print the uids in UTF8.  Remove
	mark_non_selfsigned_uids_valid().

	* keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names): Show revocation key as
	UTF8.

	* sign.c (clearsign_file): Allow --not-dash-escaped to work with
	v3 keys.

2002-03-14  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* main.h: Changed the default algorithms to CAST5 and SHA1.

2002-03-13  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* import.c (chk_self_sigs): Show which user ID a bad self-sig
	(invald sig or unsupported public key algorithm) resides on.

	* import.c (chk_self_sigs): any valid self-sig should mark a user
	ID or subkey as valid - otherwise, an attacker could DoS the user
	by inventing a bogus invalid self-signature.

2002-03-07  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (main): make a few more strings translatable.

	* options.h, options.skel, g10.c (main), gpgv.c, mainproc.c
	(check_sig_and_print), keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_options):
	--auto-key-retrieve should really be a keyserver-option variable.

	* import.c (revocation_present): new function to print a warning
	if a key is imported that has been revoked by designated revoker,
	but the designated revoker is not present to verify the
	revocation.  If keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve is set, try
	and fetch the designated revoker from the keyserver.

	* import.c (import_one): call revocation_present after importing a
	new key.  Note that this applies to --import, --recv-keys, and
	--search-keys.

	* keyserver-internal.h, keyserver.c (keyserver_import_fprint):
	import via fingerprint (for revocation keys).

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_import_keyid): much simpler
	implementation now that we're using KEYDB_SEARCH_DESC internally.

2002-03-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* revoke.c (gen_revoke): do not prompt for revocation reason for
	v3 revocations (unless force-v4-certs is on) since they wouldn't
	be used anyway.

	* keyedit.c (menu_revsig): show the status of the sigs
	(exportable? revocable?) to the user before prompting for which
	sig to revoke.  Also, make sure that local signatures get local
	revocations.

	* keyedit.c (ask_revoke_sig): remind the user which sigs are
	local.

	* g10.c (main): Add "exec-path" variable to override PATH for
	execing programs.

	* export.c (do_export_stream): properly check return code from
	classify_user_id to catch unclassifiable keys.

2002-03-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* parse-packet.c (parse_signature): variable type tweak for RISC
	OS (from Stefan)

2002-02-28  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* getkey.c (check_revocation_keys): New function to check a
	revocation against a list of potential revocation keys.  Note the
	loop-breaking code here.  This is to prevent blowing up if A is
	B's revocation key, while B is also A's.  Note also that this is
	written so that a revoked revoker can still issue revocations:
	i.e. If A revokes B, but A is revoked, B is still revoked.  I'm
	not completely convinced this is the proper behavior, but it
	matches how PGP does it.  It does at least have the advantage of
	much simpler code - my first version of this had lots of loop
	maintaining code so you could chain revokers many levels deep and
	if D was revoked, C was not, which meant that B was, and so on.
	It was sort of scary, actually.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main): Add any revocation keys onto the
	pk.  This is particularly interesting since we normally only get
	data from the most recent 1F signature, but you need multiple 1F
	sigs to properly handle revocation keys (PGP does it this way, and
	a revocation key could be marked "sensitive" and hence in a
	different signature).  Also, if a pk has a revocation key set,
	check for revocation sigs that were not made by us - if made by a
	valid revocation key, mark the pk revoked.

	* packet.h, getkey.c (cache_public_key): do not cache key if
	"dont_cache" is set.  This allows the revocation key code to look
	up a key and return information that may be inaccurate to prevent
	loops without caching the fake data.

	* packet.h, sig-check.c (do_signature_check): Record if a
	signature was made by a revoked pk.

	* packet.h, parse-packet.c (parse_one_sig_subpkt,
	can_handle_critical, parse_signature): Get revocation key
	information out of direct sigs.

	* keylist.c (list_keyblock_print): don't assume that the presence
	of a 0x20 signature means the key is revoked.  With revocation
	keys, this may not be true if the revocation key is not around to
	verify it or if verification failed.  Also, 0x1F should get listed
	as "sig", and not "unexpected signature class".

	* keyedit.c (show_key_with_all_names): Add a flag for printing
	revoker information and change all callers.

	* import.c (merge_blocks): merge in any new direct key (0x1F)
	sigs.

	* import.c (import_revoke_cert): don't keep processing after a
	revocation is rejected.

	* import.c (delete_inv_parts): Allow importing a revocation
	signature even if it was not issued by the key.  This allows a
	revocation key to issue it.  Of course, the sig still needs to be
	checked before we trust it.

	* free-packet.c (copy_public_key): Include a new copy of the
	revocation keys when duping a pk.

	* free-packet.c (free_seckey_enc, release_public_key_parts): Free
	any revocation keys that are attached to a sig or pk.

	* export.c (do_export_stream): Do not export signatures with
	"sensitive" revocation keys in them.

2002-02-27  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* export.c (do_export_stream): Do not include v3 keys in a
	--export-secret-subkeys export.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main): If a key isn't valid (say,
	because of no self-signature), allow --always-trust to force it
	valid so it can be trusted.

2002-02-25  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* hkp.c (hkp_ask_import), hkp.h, keyserver.c (all): treat key
	lists internally as fingerprints when possible.  All this is via
	KEYDB_SEARCH_DESC - no point in reinventing the wheel. This allows
	the helper program to search the keyserver by fingerprint if
	desired (and the keyserver supports it).  Note that automatic
	fingerprint promotion during refresh only applies to v4 keys as a
	v4 fingerprint can be easily changed into a long or short key id,
	and a v3 cannot.

	* pubkey-enc.c, getkey.c, misc.c, main.h: Take two copies of
	hextobyte() from pubkey-enc.c and getkey.c and make them into one
	copy in misc.c.

2002-02-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_search_prompt): Detect a "no keys found"
	case even if the helper program does not explicitly say how many
	keys were found.

	* hkp.c (parse_hkp_index): Bug fix - don't report non-revoked keys
	as revoked in HKP key searches.

2002-02-19  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* parse-packet.c (parse_trust): Made parsing more robust.

2002-02-19  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* hkp.c (parse_hkp_index): Catch corruption in HKP index lines
	(can be caused by broken or malicious keyservers).

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_work): Add KEYSERVER_NOT_SUPPORTED for
	unsupported actions (say, a keyserver that has no way to search,
	or a readonly keyserver that has no way to add).  Also add a
	USE_EXTERNAL_HKP define to disable the internal HKP keyserver
	code.

2002-02-14  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* g10.c: New option --no-use-agent.

	* pkclist.c (check_signatures_trust): Always print the warning for
	unknown and undefined trust.  Removed the did_add cruft.  Reported
	by Janusz A. Urbanowicz.

2002-02-11  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* hkp.c (parse_hkp_index): Bug fix - properly handle user IDs with
	colons (":") in them while HKP searching.

2002-02-09  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* misc.c (pct_expando): More comments.

	* keydb.h, sign.c (mk_notation_and_policy): Clarify what is a sig
	and what is a cert.  A sig has sigclass 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, or 0x40,
	and everything else is a cert.

	* g10.c (main), keyedit.c (keyedit_menu): Add a "nrlsign" for
	nonrevocable and local key signatures.

	* g10.c (main): Add a --no-force-mdc to undo --force-mdc.

	* options.h, g10.c (main), cipher.c (write_header): Add a knob to
	--disable-mdc/--no-disable-mdc.  Off by default, of course, but is
	used in --pgp2 and --pgp6 modes.

	* pkclist.c (build_pk_list): Allow specifying multiple users in
	the "Enter the user ID" loop.  Enter a blank line to stop.  Show
	each key+id as it is added.

	* keylist.c (show_policy_url), mainproc.c (print_notation_data):
	It is not illegal (though possibly silly) to have multiple policy
	URLs in a given signature, so print all that are present.

	* hkp.c (hkp_search): More efficient implementation of URL-ifying
	code.

2002-02-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* main.h, misc.c (pct_expando): New function to generalize
	%-expando processing in any arbitrary string.

	* photoid.c (show_photo): Call the new pct_expando function rather
	than expand strings internally.

	* sign.c (mk_notation_and_policy): Show policy URLs and notations
	when making a signature if show-policy/show-notation is on.
	%-expand policy URLs during generation.  This lets the user have
	policy URLs of the form "http://notary.jabberwocky.com/keysign/%K"
	which will generate a per-signature policy URL.

	* main.h, keylist.c (show_policy_url, show_notation): Add amount
	to indent so the same function can be used in key listings as well
	as during sig generation.  Change all callers.

2002-02-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c, options.h (parse_keyserver_options, keyidlist):
	Workaround for the pksd and OKS keyserver bug that calculates v4
	RSA keyids as if they were v3.  The workaround/hack is to fetch
	both the v4 (e.g. 99242560) and v3 (e.g. 68FDDBC7) keyids.  This
	only happens for key refresh while using the HKP scheme and the
	refresh-add-fake-v3-keyids keyserver option must be set.  This
	should stay off by default.

2002-02-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Bug fix - do not append keys to
	each other when --sending more than one.

2002-02-02  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* options.h, g10.c (main), keyedit.c (sign_uids), sign.c
	(mk_notation_and_policy): Split "--set-policy-url" into
	"--cert-policy-url" and "--sig-policy-url" so the user can set
	different policies for key and data signing.  For backwards
	compatibility, "--set-policy-url" sets both, as before.

2002-01-30  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* g10.c (main): --gen-random --armor does now output a base64
	encoded string.

2002-01-28  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (main), options.h, pkclist.c (algo_available): --pgp6
	flag.  This is not nearly as involved as --pgp2.  In short, it
	turns off force_mdc, turns on no_comment, escape_from, and
	force_v3_sigs, and sets compression to 1.  It also restricts the
	user to IDEA (if present), 3DES, CAST5, MD5, SHA1, and RIPEMD160.
	See the comments above algo_available() for lots of discussion on
	why you would want to do this.

2002-01-27  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (keygen_set_std_prefs): Comment

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids): Bug fix - when signing with multiple
	secret keys at the same time, make sure each key gets the sigclass
	prompt.

	* exec.c (exec_finish): Close the iobuf and FILE before trying to
	waitpid, so the remote process will get a SIGPIPE and exit.  This
	is only a factor when using a pipe to communicate.

	* exec.c (exec_write): Disable cache-on-close of the fd iobuf (is
	this right?  Why is a fd iobuf cached at all?)

2002-01-26  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* g10.c, options.h: New option --gpg-agent-info
	* passphrase.c (agent_open): Let it override the environment info.
	* seckey-cert.c (check_secret_key): Always try 3 times when the
	agent is enabled.
	* options.skel: Describe --use-agent.

2002-01-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* pubkey-enc.c (is_algo_in_prefs, get_it): Only check preferences
	against keys with v4 self sigs - there is really little point in
	warning for every single non-IDEA message encrypted to an old key.

	* pkclist.c (select_algo_from_prefs): Only put in the fake IDEA
	preference if --pgp2 is on.

	* mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print): Print "Expired" for expired
	but good signatures (this still prints "BAD" for expired but bad
	signatures).

2002-01-23  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keygen.c (ask_keysize): Cosmetic: don't present a RSA signing
	key as a "keypair" which can be 768 bits long (as RSA minimum is
	1024).

	* pubkey-enc.c (is_algo_in_prefs): Allow IDEA as a fake preference
	for v3 keys with v3 selfsigs.

2002-01-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* packet.h, getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_main), pkclist.c
	(select_algo_from_prefs): Implement the fake IDEA preference as
	per RFC2440:12.1.  This doesn't mean that IDEA will be used (the
	plugin may not be present), but it does mean that a v3 key with a
	v3 selfsig has an implicit IDEA preference instead of 3DES.  v3
	keys with v4 selfsigs use preferences as normal.

	* encode.c (encode_crypt): if select_algo_from_prefs fails, this
	means that we could not find a cipher that both keys like.  Since
	all v4 keys have an implicit 3DES preference, this means there is
	a v3 key with a v3 selfsig in the list.  Use 3DES in this case as
	it is the safest option (we know the v4 key can handle it, and
	we'll just hope the v3 key is being used in an implementation that
	can handle it).  If --pgp2 is on, warn the user what we're doing
	since it'll probably break PGP2 compatibility.

	* g10.c (main): Do not force using IDEA for encrypted files in
	--pgp2 mode - let the fake IDEA preference choose this for us for
	better compatibility when encrypting to multiple keys, only some
	of which are v3.

	* keygen.c (keygen_set_std_prefs): Put 3DES on the end of the
	default cipher pref list (RFC2440: "...it is good form to place it
	there explicitly.").  If the user has the IDEA plugin installed,
	put a preference for IDEA *after* 3DES to effectively disable its
	use for everything except encrypting along with v3 keys.

	* encode.c, g10.c, sign.c: Change the PGP2 warning line from
	"... will not be usable ..." to "... may not be usable ..." as the
	user could be using one of the enhanced PGP2 variations.

	* helptext.c: Revise the sign_uid.class help text as suggested by
	Stefan.

2002-01-20  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* passphrase.c (passphrase_to_dek): Add tryagain_text arg to be
	used with the agent.  Changed all callers.
	(agent_get_passphrase): Likewise and send it to the agent
	* seckey-cert.c (do_check): New arg tryagain_text.
	(check_secret_key): Pass the string to do_check.
	* keygen.c (ask_passphrase): Set the error text is required.
	* keyedit.c (change_passphrase): Ditto.

	* passphrase.c (agent_open): Disable opt.use_agent in case of a
	problem with the agent.
	(agent_get_passphrase): Ditto.
	(passphrase_clear_cache): Ditto.

2002-01-19  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* passphrase.c (agent_open): Add support for the new Assuan based
	gpg-agent.  New arg to return the used protocol version.
	(agent_get_passphrase): Implemented new protocol here.
	(passphrase_clear_cache): Ditto.
	(readline): New.

2002-01-15  Timo Schulz  <ts@winpt.org>

	* encode.c (encode_crypt_files): Fail if --output is used.

	* g10.c: New command --decrypt-files.

	* decrypt.c (decrypt_messages): New.

2002-01-09  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c, misc.c, gpgv.c: move idea_cipher_warn to misc.c so gpgv.c
	doesn't need a stub for it any longer.

	* g10.c (get_temp_dir), main.h: no longer used (it's in exec.c now)

	* g10.c (main), delkey.c (delete_keys), main.h : Allow
	--delete-key (now --delete-keys, though --delete-key still works,
	of course) to delete multiple keys in one go.  This applies to
	--delete-secret-key(s) and --delete-secret-and-public-key(s) as
	well.

2002-01-09  Timo Schulz  <ts@winpt.org>

	* encode.c (encode_crypt_files): Now it behaves like verify_files.

	* g10.c (main): We don't need to check argc for encode_crypt_files
	any longer.

2002-01-09  Timo Schulz  <ts@winpt.org>

	* exec.c: Include windows.h for dosish systems.

2002-01-08  Timo Schulz  <ts@winpt.org>

	* g10.c (main): New description for --encrypt-files.

2002-01-08  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* g10.c (main): Must register the secring for encryption because
	it is needed to figure out the default recipient.  Reported by
	Roger Sondermann.

2002-01-05  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyedit.c (menu_adduid): Require --expert before adding a photo
	ID to a v3 key, and before adding a second photo ID to any key.

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu): Don't allow adding photo IDs in
	rfc1991 or pgp2 mode.

	* getkey.c (merge_selfsigs_subkey): Permit v3 subkeys.  Believe it
	or not, this is allowed by rfc 2440, and both PGP 6 and PGP 7 work
	fine with them.

	* g10.c, options.h, keyedit.c, sign.c: Move the "ask for
	expiration" switch off of --expert, which was getting quite
	overloaded, and onto ask-sig-expire and ask-cert-expire.  Both
	default to off.

	* g10.c (main): Change the default compression algo to 1, to be
	more OpenPGP compliant (PGP also uses this, so it'll help with
	interoperability problems as well).

	* encode.c (encode_crypt): Handle compression algo 2, since the
	default is now 1.

	* build-packet.c (build_attribute_subpkt): Fix off-by-one error.

2002-01-05  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* g10.c (main): Do not register the secret keyrings for certain
	commands.

	* keydb.c (keydb_add_resource): Use access to test for keyring
	existence.  This avoids cached opened files which are bad under
	RISC OS.

2002-01-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* sign.c (sign_file, sign_symencrypt_file): always use one-pass
	packets unless rfc1991 is enabled.  This allows a signature made
	with a v3 key to work in PGP 6 and 7.  Signatures made with v4
	keys are unchanged.

	* g10.c (main): Disallow non-detached signatures in PGP2 mode.
	Move the "you must use files and not pipes" PGP2 warning up so all
	the PGP2 stuff is together.

	* encode.c (encode_simple): Use the actual filesize instead of
	partial length packets in the internal literal packet from a
	symmetric message.  This breaks PGP5(?), but fixes PGP2, 6, and 7.
	It's a decent tradeoff.  Note there was only an issue with
	old-style RFC1991 symmetric messages.  2440-style messages in 6
	and 7 work with or without partial length packets.

2002-01-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (main): Removed --no-default-check-level option, as it is
	not consistent with other "default" options.  Plus, it is the same
	as saying --default-check-level 0.

	* exec.c (exec_read): Disallow caching tempfile from child
	process, as this keeps the file handle open and can cause unlink
	problems on some platforms.

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_search_prompt): Minor tweak - don't
	bother to transform keyids into textual form if they're just going
	to be transformed back to numbers.

2002-01-03  Timo Schulz <ts@winpt.org>

	* g10.c: New command --encrypt-files.

	* verify.c (print_file_status): Removed the static because
	encode_crypt_files also uses this function.

	* main.h (print_files_status): New.
	(encode_crypt_files): New.

	* encode.c (encode_crypt_files): New.

2002-01-02  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* keyserver.c: Moved util.h include down in order to avoid
	redefinition problems on RISC OS.

	* keyring.c (keyring_lock): Only lock keyrings that are writable.

	* keyring.c (keyring_update_keyblock): Close unused iobuf.

	* hkp.c (parse_hkp_index, hkp_search) [__riscos__]: Changed
	unsigned char* to char* because of compiler issues.

	* exec.c (exec_finish) [__riscos__]: Invalidate close cache so
	that file can be unlinked.

2001-12-28  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (main): Use a different strlist to check extensions since
	they need to be handled seperately now.

	* misc.c,main.h (check_permissions): Properly handle permission
	and ownership checks on files in the lib directory
	(e.g. /usr/local/lib/gnupg), which are owned by root and are
	world-readable, and change all callers to specify extension or
	per-user file.

	* photoid.c (show_photo), keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Bug fix -
	don't call exec_finish if exec_write fails.

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Look for OPTIONS from the
	keyserver helper - specifically, a "OUTOFBAND" option for the
	email keyserver.

	* mainproc.c (list_node), keylist.c (list_keyblock_colon),
	import.c (delete_inv_parts), export.c (do_export_stream): Use
	signature flags for exportability check rather than re-parsing the
	subpacket.

	* keyid.c, keydb.h (get_lsign_letter): No longer needed.

2001-12-27  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* exec.c (exec_finish): Show errors when temp files cannot be
	deleted for whatever reason.

	* exec.c (exec_read): Don't rely on WEXITSTATUS being present.

	* exec.c (make_tempdir): Add temp file creator for win32.  Don't
	create an incoming temp file if the exec is write-only.

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Clean up error handling, for when
	the spawn fails.

	* photoid.c (show_photo): Clean up error handling.

	* misc.c (check_permissions): Neaten.

2001-12-25  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* mkdtemp.c (mkdtemp): Add copyleft info and tweak the 'X' counter
	to be a bit simpler.

	* keyserver.c, photoid.c: Remove unused headers left over from
	when the exec functions lived there.

2001-12-23  Timo Schulz <ts@winpt.org>

	* misc.c (check_permissions): Do not use it for W32 systems.

	* tdbio.c (migrate_from_v2): Define ftruncate as chsize() for W32.

	* mkdtemp.c: W32 support.

	* photoid.c: Ditto.

	* exec.c: Ditto.

2001-12-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* exec.c (make_tempdir): avoid compiler warning with const

	* mkdtemp.c (mkdtemp): catch the empty ("") string case in case
	someone repurposes mkdtemp at some point.

	* photoid.c (generate_photo_id, show_photo): some type changes
	from Stefan Bellon.

	* exec.c (make_tempdir): handle Win32 systems, suggested by Timo
	Schulz.

2001-12-22  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* encode.c (encode_simple, encode_crypt): i18n 2 strings.

2001-12-22  Timo Schulz <ts@winpt.org>

	* encode.c (encode_simple, encode_crypt): Use is_file_compressed
	to avoid to compress compressed files.

2001-12-22  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Removed some variables
	declaration due to shadowing warnings.

	* build-packet.c (build_attribute_subpkt): s/index/idx/ to avoid
	compiler warnig due to index(3).

	* getkey.c (get_ctx_handle): Use KEYDB_HANDLE as return value.
	* keylist.c (list_one): Made resname const.

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu): Allow "addphoto" only when --openpgp is
	not used.

	* options.skel: Changed one example photo viewer to qiv.

2001-12-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am: add exec.c, exec.h, photoid.c, and photoid.h

	* build-packet.c (build_attribute_subpkt): new function to build
	the raw attribute subpacket.  Note that attribute subpackets have
	the same format as signature subpackets.

	* exec.c: new file with generic exec-a-program functionality.
	Used by both photo IDs and keyserver helpers.  This is pretty much
	the same code that used to be keyserver specific, with some
	changes to be usable generically.

	* free-packet.c (free_attributes (new)): function to free an
	attribute packet.

	* gpgv.c: added stub show_photo

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu, menu_adduid, menu_showphoto): can add a
	photo (calls generate_photo_id), or display a photo (calls
	show_photo) from the --edit menu.  New commands are "addphoto",
	and "delphoto" (same as "deluid").

	* keylist.c (list_keyblock_print): show photos during key list if
	--show-photos enabled.

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): use the generic exec_xxx
	functions to call keyserver helper.

	* g10.c, options.h: three new options - --{no-}show-photos, and
	--photo-viewer to give the command line to display a picture.

	* options.skel: instructions for the photo viewer

	* parse-packet.c (parse_user_id, setup_user_id (new)): common code
	for both user IDs and attribute IDs moved to setup_user_id.

	* parse-packet.c (make_attribute_uidname (new)): constructs a fake
	"name" for attribute packets (e.g. "[image of size ...]")

	* parse-packet.c (parse_attribute (replaces parse_photo_id),
	parse_attribute_subpkts): Builds an array of individual
	attributes.  Currently only handles attribute image / type jpeg
	subpackets.

	* sign.c (hash_uid): Fix bug in signing attribute (formerly
	photo_id) packets.

	* packet.h, and callers: globally change "photo_id" to "attribute"
	and add structures for attributes.  The packet format is generic
	attributes, even though the only attribute type thus far defined
	is jpeg.

2001-12-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* parse-packet.c (can_handle_critical): Can handle critical
	revocation subpackets now.

	* trustdb.c (mark_usable_uid_certs): Disregard revocations for
	nonrevocable sigs.  Note that this allows a newer revocable
	signature to override an older nonrevocable signature.

	* sign.c (make_keysig_packet): add a duration field and change all
	callers.  This makes make_keysig_packet closer to
	write_signature_packets and removes some duplicated expiration
	code.

	* keyedit.c (keyedit_menu, menu_revsig, sign_uids,
	sign_mk_attrib): Add nrsign command, don't allow revoking a
	nonrevocable signature,

	* g10.c (main): Add --nrsign option to nonrevocably sign a key
	from the command line.

	* build-packet.c (build_sig_subpkt_from_sig): Comment to explain
	the use of CRITICAL.

2001-12-21  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* g10.c. options.h : New option --show-keyring
	* getkey.c (get_ctx_handle): New.
	* keylist.c (list_one): Implement option here.  By David Champion.

2001-12-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Use mkdtemp() to make temp
	directory.

	* mkdtemp.c: replacement function for those platforms that don't
	have mkdtemp (make a temp directory securely).

2001-12-19  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* misc.c (check_permissions): New function to stat() and ensure
	the permissions of GNUPGHOME and the files have safe permissions.

	* keydb.c (keydb_add_resource): Check keyring permissions.

	* tdbio.c (tdbio_set_dbname): Check permissions of trustdb.gpg

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Disable keyserver schemes that
	involve running external programs if the options file has unsafe
	permissions or ownership.

	* g10.c, options.h: New option --no-permission-warning to disable
	the permission warning message(s).  This also permits use of the
	keyserver if it had been disabled (see above).  Also check the
	permissions/ownership of random_seed.

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): The new glibc prints a warning
	when using mktemp() (the code was already secure, but the warning
	was bound to cause confusion).  Use a different implementation
	based on get_random_bits() instead.  Also try a few times to get
	the temp dir before giving up.

2001-12-19  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* g10.c, passphrase.c [CYGWIN32]: Allow this as an alias for MINGW32.

2001-12-18  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c (idea_cipher_warn): Add a flag to show the warning always
	or once per session and change all callers (show always except for
	the secret key protection and unknown cipher from an encrypted
	message errors).  Also make the strings translatable.

	* pubkey-enc.c (get_it): Add the IDEA cipher warning if the user
	tries to decrypt an IDEA encrypted message without the IDEA
	plugin.

	* keyserver.c (parse_keyserver_uri): More strict checking of the
	keyserver URI.  Specifically, fail if the ":port" section is
	anything except a number between 1 and 65535.

2001-12-17  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* keyserver.c (print_keyinfo): No need to check for
	control/illegal characters, as utf8_to_native does this for us.

	* mainproc.c (proc_encrypted): Use generic IDEA warning.

	* gpgv.c: add stub for idea_cipher_warn

	* g10.c, hkp.c, keyserver.c: Fix capitalization and plural issues.

	* encode.c (encode_crypt), sign.c (sign_file, clearsign_file):
	disable pgp2 mode after the message is no longer pgp2 compatible.

	* g10.c (main): Tweak the PGP2.x IDEA warning to use the generic
	warning, and not merely fail if the IDEA plugin isn't there.

	* g10.c (main, idea_cipher_warn), keygen.c (set_one_pref),
	seckey-cert.c (do_check): Add a generic IDEA warning for when the
	IDEA plugin is not present.  This pops up when the user uses
	"--cipher-algo idea", when setpref is used to set a "S1"
	preference, and when a secret key protected with IDEA is used.

2001-12-15  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* keyserver.c (keyserver_spawn): Assert that we have dropped privs.

2001-12-13  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* pubkey-enc.c (get_session_key): Check that the public key
	algorithm is indeed usable for en/decryption.  This avoid a
	strange error message from pubkey_decrypt if for some reasons a
	bad algorithm indentifier is passed.

2001-12-12  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Fixed some types for portability.  Noted by Stefan Bellon.

2001-12-11  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* hkp.c (hkp_export): Do not print possible control characters
	from a keyserver response.
	(parse_hkp_index): Made uid an unsigned char* because it is passed to
	isspace().
	(hkp_search): Ditto for the char* vars.

	* g10.c (main): Print the IDEA warning also for -c and -se.

	* g10.c (get_temp_dir): Assert that we have dropped privs

	* encode.c (encode_crypt): Include the first key into the --pgp2
	check.

2001-12-07  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* g10.c, options.h: New option --pgp2.  This is identical to
	"--rfc1991 --cipher-algo idea --compress-algo 1 --digest-algo md5
	--force_v3_sigs" with the addition of an warning to advise the
	user not to use a pipe (which would break pgp2 compatibility).

	* encode.c (encode_crypt): warn if the user tries to encrypt to
	any key that is not RSA and <= 2048 bits when the --pgp2 option is
	used.

	* sign.c (sign_file, clearsign_file): When using --pgp2, make a v3
	sig, and warn if the signature is made with a non-v3 key.

2001-12-05  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* sign.c (sign_file, clearsign_file, sign_symencrypt_file): Prompt
	for sig expiration if --expert is set and --force-v3-sigs is not
	set (v3 sigs cannot expire).

	* mainproc.c (check_sig_and_print): After checking a sig, print
	expiration status.  This causes a error return if the sig is
	expired.

	* build-packet.c (build_sig_subpkt_from_sig): Include a critical
	sig expiration subpacket if the sig is to expire.

	* keyedit.c (sign_uids): Do not sign an expired key unless
	--expert is set, in which case prompt.  Also, offer to expire a
	signature when the key the user is signing expires.

	packets.  However, the other solution provides an cleaner
	interface and opens the path to get access to other information
	from the armore headers.
	(release_list): Reset some more variables.

2000-10-13  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

        should solve a lot of compatibility problems with other OpenPGP

        that this would disable a couple of workarounds for PGP.
