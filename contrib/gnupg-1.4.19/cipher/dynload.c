 * Here is the ancient comment:
 * Register an extension module.  The last registered module will
 * be loaded first.  A name may have a list of classes
 * appended; e.g:
 *	mymodule.so(1:17,3:20,3:109)
 * means that this module provides digest algorithm 17 and public key
 * algorithms 20 and 109.  This is only a hint but if it is there the
 * loader may decide to only load a module which claims to have a
 * requested algorithm.
 *
 * mainpgm is the path to the program which wants to load a module
 * it is only used in some environments.
