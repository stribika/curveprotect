Note for translators
--------------------

Some strings in GnuPG are for matching user input against.  These
strings can accept multiple values that mean essentially the same
thing.

For example, the string "yes" in English is "sí" in Spanish.  However,
some users will type "si" (without the accent).  To accomodate both
users, you can translate the string "yes" as "sí|si".  You can have
any number of alternate matches seperated by the | character like
"sí|si|seguro".

The strings that can be handled in this way are of the form "yes|yes",
(or "no|no", etc.) There should also be a comment in the .po file
directing you to this file.



Sending new or updated translations
-----------------------------------

Please note that we do not use the TP Robot but require that
translations are to be send by mail to translations@gnupg.org.  We
also strongly advise to get subscribed to i18n@gnupg.org and request
assistance if it is not clear on how to translate certain strings.  A
wrongly translated string may lead to a security problem.

A copyright disclaimer to the FSF is required by all translators.
