slownacl

Public domain.

slownacl is a high-level reference implementation of the Python NaCl
API.  It is intended to be readily understandable.

WARNING: Because slownacl uses Python's native big number support, it
cannot guarantee timing invariance.  Its use should therefore be
limited to situations where timing attacks are not an issue.
