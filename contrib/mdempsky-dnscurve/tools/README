This directory contains a hodgepodge of different Python code snippets
for working with DNS and DNSCurve.

The most interesting place to start is dnsq.py, which it a dig-like
DNS query tool with DNSCurve capability.  See the documentation at the
top of dnsq.py for instructions on its use.

You will need "nacl" or "slownacl" in your Python load path to use
some of these tools.  The easiest way to do this right now is to
simply symlink the slownacl directory into this one, e.g.:

    $ ln -s ../slownacl ./
