Knot DNS THANKS file

Knot DNS was originally written by CZ.NIC Labs.  It would not be what
it is today without the invaluable help of these people, who have
reported problems, suggested improvements, or submitted actual code.
Please help us keep this list complete and free from errors.  Also see
the AUTHORS file for the list of people with contributions significant
enough to warrant copyright assignment.
